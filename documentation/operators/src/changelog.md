### Features

- New `nym-node` API endpoint `/api/v1/auxiliary-details`: to expose any additional information. Currently it's just the location. `nym-api` will then query all nodes for that information and put it in the `self-described` endpoint.
- New `nym-node` location available - use one of the three options to add this to your node config:
    1. Update the `location` field under `[host]` section of `config.toml`
    2. For new nodes: Initialise the node with `--location` flag, where they have to provide the country info. Either full country name (e.g. 'Jamaica'), two-letter alpha2 (e.g. 'JM'), three-letter alpha3 (e.g. 'JAM') or three-digit numeric-3 (e.g. '388') can be provided.
    3. For existing nodes: It's also possible to use exactly the same `--location` argument as above, but make sure to also provide `--write-changes` (or `-w`) flag to persist those changes!
- [Feature/unstable tested nodes endpoint](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4601): Adds new data structures (`TestNode`, `TestRoute`, `PartialTestResult`) to handle test results for Mixnodes and Gateways. With the inclusion of pagination to handle large API responses efficiently. Lastly, introducing a new route with the tag `unstable` thus meaning not to be consumed without a user risk, prefixes in endpoints with unstable, are what it says on the tin.
~~~admonish example collapsible=true title='Testing steps performed'
- Deploy new api changes to sandbox environment
- Ensure current operations are transactional and standed operations are working
- Run a script to ensure that the new endpoints are working as expected with pagination

- [`nym-api`: make report/avg_uptime endpoints ignore blacklist](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4599): When querying for node specific data, it's no longer going to go through the entire list of all cached (and filtered nodes) to find it; instead it will attempt to retrieve a single unfiltered entry.
~~~admonish example collapsible=true title='Testing steps performed'
- Build the project and deployed it in a test environment.
- Manually test API endpoints for mixnode and gateway data.
- Verify that the endpoints return the expected data and handle blacklists correctly.
- API performance improved due to the efficient `HashMap` lookups
- Data in mainnet will differ from test nets due to the increased amount of gateways and mixnodes in that environment
- Test standard uptime routes:
```sh
curl -X 'GET' 'https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/status/gateway/Fo4f4SQLdoyoGkFae5TpVhRVoXCF8UiypLVGtGjujVPf/avg_uptime' -H 'accept: application/json'
```
~~~

- [Use rfc3339 for last_polled in described nym-api endpoint](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4591): Fix issue where the validator-client can't parse the nym-api response for the described endpoint, in particular the `latest_polled` field that was recently added, by making the field use `rfc3339`
    - **Note:** This will require upgrading `nym-api` and everything that depends on the described endpoint.
~~~admonish example collapsible=true title='Testing steps performed'
- Update a `nym-api` to the binary built from this branch, then restart the api
- Check the `journalctl` for error messages
- Connected via client and could not see the error messages, this is backwards compatible
- Local testing using sdk examples:
```sh
cd <PATH_TO>/nym/sdk/rust/nym-sdk
cargo run --example simple

# outcome

```
~~~

- [Upgrade `axum` and related dependencies to the most recent version](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4573)
- [Run cargo autoinherit on the main workspace](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4553): Move several dependencies to the workspace level using cargo autoinherit, to make it easier to keep our dependencies up to date.
    - Run cargo autoinherit in the root
    - Merge in the new workspace deps in the main list
    - We made sure to not mix in other changes as well - all features flags for all crates should be the same as before
~~~admonish example collapsible=true title='Testing steps performed'
- Run `cargo autoinherit` in the root directory to move dependencies to the workspace level
- Merge the new workspace dependencies into the main list
- Ensure no other changes were mixed in during the process
- Verify that all feature flags for all crates remained the same as before
- Build all the binaries from this branch to confirm successful compilation
- Deploy the built binaries across different environments to ensure there were no issues
~~~

- [Add rustls-tls to reqwest in validator-client](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4552): An attempt to make possible to end up in a situation where use use the validator-client but without functioning TLS support. For the monorepo this is masked by cargo feature unification, but becomes a problem for outside consumers, as as been noticed in many of the vpn client implementations.
    - In `validator-client`: `reqwest`, enable `rustls-tls` for `non-wasm32`
    - In `client-core`: Use default features enabled for `non-wasm32` and switch to `webpki` roots, since that's what we're using with `reqwest` anyway
    - In `gateway-client`: Switch to `webpki` roots, since that's what we're using with `reqwest` anyway

#### Crypto

- [Remove blocking for coconut in the final epoch state](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4598)
~~~admonish example collapsible=true title='Testing steps performed'
- Build the project to ensure no compilation errors
- Run tests to verify the functionality of the `issue_credential` function
- Execute integration tests to check the behaviour during an epoch transition.
~~~

- [Allow using explicit admin address for issuing freepasses](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4595)
- [Explicitly handle constraint unique violation when importing credential](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4588): Add a strong type for when a duplicate credential is imported so the vpn lib can handle this.
- [Feature/wasm coconut](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4584): This pull request requires [\#4585](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4585) to be merged first
- [Feature/nyxd scraper pruning](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4564): This PR introduces storage pruning to `nyxd` scraper which is then used by the validators rewarder.
~~~admonish example collapsible=true title='Testing steps performed'
- Add a `main.rs` file in the `nyxd` scraper dir, underneath `lib.rs`, amend `config.pruning_options.validate()?;` to be `let _ = config.pruning_options.validate();` in the mod.rs file
- Test the different variations of `pruning_options`:
    - Check the *default* option: `pruning_options: PruningOptions::default()`
    - Check the *nothing* option: `pruning_options: PruningOptions::nothing()`
    - Check the *custom* option, example: `pruning_options: PruningOptions { keep_recent: (500), interval: (10), strategy: (PruningStrategy::Custom) }`
    - Check the pruning *in real life* for the validator rewarder
- Validate that the database table `blocks` was being updated accordingly
~~~

- [Feature/rewarder voucher issuance](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4548)
    - Introduces signature checks on issued credential data
    - Stores evidence of any failures/malicious behaviour in the internal db

### Bugfix

- [`noop` flag for `nym-api` for `nymvisor` compatibility](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4586)
    - The application starts correctly and logs the starting message
    - The `--no_banner` flag works as intended, providing compatibility with `nymvisor`
~~~admonish example collapsible=true title='Testing steps performed'
- Build the project to ensure no compilation errors
- Run the binary with different command-line arguments to verify the CLI functionality
- Test with and without the `--no_banner` flag to ensure compatibility and expected behavior
- Verify logging setup and configuration file parsing
~~~

### Operators Guide updates

- [`nym-gateway-probe`](testing/gateway-probe.md): A CLI tool to check in-real-time networking status of any Gateway locally.
- [Where to host your `nym-node`?](legal/isp-list.md): A list of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) by Nym Operators community. We invite all operators to add their experiences with different ISPs to strengthen the community knowledge and Nym mixnet performance.
- Make sure you run `nym-node` with `--wireguard-enabled false` and add a location description to your `config.toml`, both documented in [`nym-node` setup manual](nodes/setup.md#mode-exit-gateway).
