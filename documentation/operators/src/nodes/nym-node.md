# Nym Node

NYM NODE is a tool for running a node within the Nym network. Nym Nodes containing functionality such as `mixnode`, `entry-gateway` and `exit-gateway` are fundamental components of Nym Mixnet architecture. Nym Nodes are ran by decentralised node operators.

To setup any type of Nym Node, start with either building [Nym's platform](../binaries/building-nym.md) from source or download [pre-compiled binaries](../binaries/pre-built-binaries.md) on the [configured server (VPS)](vps-setup.md) where you want to run the node. Nym Node will need to be bond to [Nym's wallet](wallet-preparation.md). Follow [preliminary steps](preliminary-steps.md) page before you initialise and run a node.


This section contains setup guides for the following node types:
* [Mix Node](./mix-node-setup.md)
* [Gateway](./gateway-setup.md)
* [Network Requester](./network-requester-setup.md)
* [Validator](./validator-setup.md)
