# Mixnet contract changes

This file shall describe (hopefully) all relevant changes made to the contract as the result of changing reward calculation.

## Overview

There are two main changes performed to the mixnet contract that have a cascading effect on the rest of the system. They are as follows:

1. rewarding
2. Mixnodes are no longer stored and indexed by their identity keys. Instead they get assigned a unique `NodeId` (just an increasing `u32` id). This is to resolve my favourite ~~bug~~ feature (I will explain this in slightly more details in the next sections).
