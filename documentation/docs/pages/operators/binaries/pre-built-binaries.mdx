# Pre-built Binaries

This page is for operators who prefer to download ready made binaries. The [Github releases page](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases) has pre-built binaries which should work on Ubuntu 22.04 and other Debian-based systems, but at this stage cannot be guaranteed to work everywhere.

If the pre-built binaries don't work or are unavailable for your system, you will need to build the platform yourself.

## Setup Binaries

<VarInfo />

<Steps>

1. ###### Download binary
- Go to [Nym release page](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/), choose binary to download, click with a right button and `Copy Link...`
- Download from your terminal using `curl` or `wget` tool:
```sh
# using curl
curl -L <LINK> -o <PATH>/nym-node

# using wget
wget <LINK>
```
In case you want to download binary to your current working directory, drop `<PATH>` from the command

In case you want to download binary to your current working directory, drop `<PATH>` from the command

###### 2. Make the binary executable
- Open terminal in the same directory and run:
```sh
chmod +x <BINARY>
# for example: chmod +x nym-mixnode
```

</Steps>

Now you can use your binary. Follow the guide according to the type of your binary.

* [Nym Nodes](../nodes/nym-node.mdx)
* [Validators](../nodes/validator-setup.mdx)

You can reconfigure your binaries at any time by editing the config file located at `~/.nym/<BINARY_TYPE>/<ID>/config/config.toml` and restarting the binary process.

`<ID>` represents a local moniker that is **never** transmitted over the network. It's used to select which local config and key files (stored in `./nym`) to use for startup.
