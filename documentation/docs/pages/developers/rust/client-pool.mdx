# Client Pool

We have a configurable-size Client Pool for processes that require multiple clients in quick succession (this is used by default by the [`TcpProxyClient`](./tcpproxy) for instance)

This will be useful for developers looking to build connection logic, or just are using raw SDK clients in a sitatuation where there are multiple connections with a lot of churn.
