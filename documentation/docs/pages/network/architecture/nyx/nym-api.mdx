# Nym API

  The Nym API setup and maintenance guide has moved to the [Operator Guides book](../../../operators/nodes/validator-setup/nym-api).
</Callout>

The Nym API is a binary that will be operated by the Nyx validator set. This binary can be run in several different modes, and has two main bits of functionality:

* Network monitoring (calculating the routing score of Mixnet nodes)
* Generation and validation of [zk-nyms](../../cryptography/zk-nym/zk-nym-overview), a combination of the Coconut Selective Disclosure Credential and Offline Ecash schemes.

This is important for both the proper decentralisation of the network uptime calculation and, more pressingly, enabling the NymVPN to utilise privacy preserving payments.
