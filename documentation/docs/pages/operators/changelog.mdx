### Operators Updates & Tools

- **[Nym release binaries](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases) no longer work on distributions Debian bullseye/sid (11) / Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and older! Please upgrade your sever to Debian bookworm (Debian 12) / Ubuntu 22.04 (and newer)!** Alternatively compile the binaries from source. 

- The Nym Squad League Winter Season has concluded. Changes are coming to NSL, including the new NSL council, monthly payments for contributions, revamped reports, and more. Details available in the [Winter Season report](https://forum.nym.com/t/nym-squad-league-winter-season-report/1265).

- [New scripts to inititialise and configure multiple VMs](nodes/preliminary-steps/vps-setup/advanced#setting-up-virtual-machines): KVM setup for virtualising nodes proved to be a good approach for admins orchestrating multiple nodes on a dedicated or bare metal machines. Now there is an option of running bash scripts speeding up the process of VM initialisation and configuration, while leaving some flexibility via interactive prompts.

### Features

- [Move all workflows on ubuntu-20 to ubuntu-22](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5455): Ubuntu 20.04 runners are scheduled to be removed from set of github hosted runners. Now is as good a time as any to finally take the plunge to switch away from ubuntu-20.04 to the shiny oh so modern ubuntu-22.04 runners

- [Bump `elliptic` from `6.5.5` to `6.6.1`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5483): Bumps [`elliptic`](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic)

- [Mix throughput tester](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5661): A utility to measure mixing throughput of a node. Especially since there are some design choices with non-obvious performance penalties. For example 1 bloomfilter per connection vs 1 global bloomfilter with additional locking for replay protection.

- [Update log crate](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5667): Update `log crate` to latest, fix `format_in_format_args`, fix `to_string_in_format_args`

### Bugfix

- [Minor fixes involving key cloning and hashing](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5664): Adds fixes for several minor key related issues:
    - Copying a private keys to perform a DH
    - Perform DH against the reference to the static key to prevent memory copy of secret key material
    - Hashing an `x25519` public key without first converting to a canonical representation
    - Use derived `Hash` implementation which internally [converts to a canonical representation](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/blob/fbf1fb5339b22eaf9925e520c90f1821f79ef5db/curve25519-dalek/src/montgomery.rs#L103) before hashing

### Operators Updates & Tools

- [**Nym Wallet v1.2.16**](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/tag/nym-wallet-v1.2.16): Operators can change their parameters in the GUI interface again. Remember that while changing node settings will take effect in the next epoch (max 60 min), *Operator cost* and *Profit margin* will be updated with the change of interval (720 epochs). You can track the state of epochs and intervals [here](https://explorer.nym.spectredao.net/dashboard). Currently we are less than 24h from the end of interval, **if you were to change OC or PM, do it now!**

- [**Nym Explorer v2.1.0**](https://nym.com/explorer) is out as a beta release

- Since last release [**Wireguard exit policy is out!**](nodes/nym-node/configuration#wireguard-exit-policy-configuration). Make sure to apply it on the servers hosting `nym-node` in `exit-gateway` mode. 

#### Community Tools

Nym operators are coming with diverse backgrounds. While for some running a `nym-node` is an introduction to sys-administration, others are well seasoned builders and hackers. It's amazing to see the effort people put in order to lift each other by day-to-day mutual problem solving support in [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat). More and more people take it further and build tools to improve network monitoring and node administration. 

While we are planning to make a page aggregating these tools together, here are some tools released lately by the technical community:

- [SpectreDAO token dashboard](https://explorer.nym.spectredao.net/token): Including stats, distribution, alongside all fundamental stats

- [SpectreDAO privacy check](https://explorer.nym.spectredao.net/privacy-check): Testing users browser, IP info, WebRTC leaks, fingerprinting, extensions and most importantly whether you access via [NymVPN](https://nym.com/)

- Service status dashboards: Uptime dashboards showing status of Nym Nodes, either squads using self-hosted [Uptime Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/) or a custom dashboard, like the one from [Oceanus](https://oceanus.p17o.com/)

- [Nym Node Widget](https://github.com/koutakou/NymNodeWidget): A MacOS widget following status of your nodes by [koutakou](https://github.com/koutakou/)

- [Nymesis](https://nymesis.vercel.app/): Beta version of an explorer tracking node rewards in a simple graph

### Features

- [Bump `next` from `13.5.7` to `14.2.15` in `/documentation/docs`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5281): Bumps [`next`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)

- [Bump `next` from `14.1.4` to `14.2.21` in `/explorer-nextjs`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5308): Bumps [`next`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)

- [Bump `nanoid` from `3.3.7` to `3.3.8` in `/documentation/docs`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5335): Bumps [`nanoid`](https://github.com/ai/nanoid)

- [Bump `store2` from `2.14.3` to `2.14.4`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5391): Bumps [`store2`](https://github.com/nbubna/store) 

- [Bump `@octokit/plugin-paginate-rest` and `@actions/github` in `/.github/actions/nym-hash-releases/src`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5488): Bumps [`@octokit/plugin-paginate-rest`](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-paginate-rest.js)

- [Clean stale partially received buffers](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5536): Clean up old `ReconstructionBuffer`s that have not received fragments in a long time. The motivation is that we want to allow the client to cap the number of re-transmissions done, meaning we can't assume that these will eventually arrive

- [Explorer V2](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5548)

- [Bump `braces` from `3.0.2` to `3.0.3` in `/sdk/typescript/packages/mix-fetch-node`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5612): Bumps [`braces`](https://github.com/micromatch/braces)

- [Bump webpack from `5.77.0` to `5.98.0` in `/wasm/client/internal-dev`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5615): Bumps [`webpack`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)

- [Feature/paginated ticketbooks challenge](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5619): This PR makes changes to how ticketbook rewarding works and in particular the challenge portion of the exchange. Rather than requesting merkle proof alongside all binary data of the associated ticketbooks in a single `/issued-ticketbooks-challenge` query (that could have potentially lead to ddos of nym-apis as it made them load all of the data into the memory at once) the query got split into `/issued-ticketbooks-challenge-commitment` for obtaining the merkle proof and `/issued-ticketbooks-data` for obtaining the binary data. Note that the latter query might have to be called multiple times with different arguments due to the enforced limit on the maximum number of values returned at once.

<AccordionTemplate name="nym-api routes">
- added:
  - `/issued-ticketbooks-count`
  - `/issued-ticketbooks-for-count/:expiration_date`
  - `/issued-ticketbooks-on-count/:issuance_date`
  - `/issued-ticketbooks-challenge-commitment`
  - `/issued-ticketbooks-data`
 
- removed:
  - `/issued-ticketbooks-challenge`
</AccordionTemplate>

<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
Testing Steps Performed:
New issue ticketbook related endpoints work -  tickets are issued and consumed as before. 
Redeeming tickets is happening as normal on the gateway side.
 
Notes (if any):
Chuckles will not require the rewarder binary to be updated; as there will be additional changes to rewarding, this will be extensively tested in the future.

### Release Summary

1. WebSocket Connection Counter Fix (this is the fix for which we have a [pre-release branch](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/tag/nym-binaries-v2025.4-dorina-nym-node-patch) out already which will be replaced by this release): Prevents incorrect session tracking for WebSockets

2. Security Fixes in Dependencies: Address known security vulnerabilities, making updating highly recommended

3. Authorisation & Timestamp Changes: Modifies how timestamps are validated in Auth v2 - this is going to be what the clients use. For example: the clients will start to use v2 variants of everything (prepping the network for the breaking change to come on April 1st which will force clients to only use v2).
    
4. Wireguard exit policy [scripts](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/scripts/wireguard-exit-policy)

### Operators Updates & Tools

- [**Wireguard exit policy is out!**](nodes/nym-node/configuration#wireguard-exit-policy-configuration) Operators can use a new guide with our scripts to setup wireguard exit policy using IP tables rules.

- [Setup commands for `nym-node` simplified](nodes/nym-node/setup#setup--run): `config.toml` defaults to correct binding addresses and ports, no need to specify unless operators want to change those values. 

- [Virtualising dedicated server with KVM now includes IPv6 setup](nodes/preliminary-steps/vps-setup/advanced#installing-kvm-on-a-server-with-ubuntu-2204): Thanks to [LunarDAO](https://lunardao.net) squad we caught a missing IPv6 configuration in KVM installation guide. Operators can now run a bare metal or dedicated server and virtualise it into VMs each with a fully functional node, having all specs fully under control.

- [NTP time synchronization guide](nodes/preliminary-steps/vps-setup#2-synchronize-time-of-your-server): Some servers had an issue with incorrect time. Please use [this guide](nodes/preliminary-steps/vps-setup#2-synchronize-time-of-your-server) to update time on your server to synchronize your node operation with the rest of the network.

- [New community managed token page by SpectreDAO](https://explorer.nym.spectredao.net/token): Based on community request, one of the squad administrating several Nym Nodes created a live token dashboard [explorer.nym.spectredao.net/token](https://explorer.nym.spectredao.net/token).

### Operators Updates & Tools

- New advanced [guide to virtualise a dedicated server](nodes/preliminary-steps/vps-setup/advanced), providing steps for experienced operators and aspiring sys-admins who seek for higher optimisation and better efficiency of their work orchestrating multiple nodes.
- New Service Grant program is being implemented by operators setting up new ~150 Exit Gateways following the updated [specs for `nym-node`](nodes#minimum-requirements)

### Features
- [Feature/chain status api](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5539):
this PR introduces `/v1/network/chain-status` endpoint on nym api to give basic information about the current block as seen by this API (with some caching) and updates `/health` endpoint to give stall information.

- [Add SURBs soft threshold](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5535): the IPR should try to keep a buffer of available SURBs to reduce latency.

- [Simplify IPR v8](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5532): purge stuff from IPR v8 to simplify; use protocol field in v8.

- [Shared instance for DNS AsyncResolver](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5523):
make the `HickoryDnsResolver` use a shared instance by default to limit fd use. Now the multiple `nym_http_api_client::Client`s that get built should take advantage of a shared connection pool for DNS lookups. If for some reason a client does need an independent AsyncResolver this can still be done with the added `thread_resolver`  function.

- [cherry-pick 17d3ff2d775f61aee381d90a304ed416c08f33fc onto dorina](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5519)

- [cherry-pick 6e5d0dac1b75413c5f09122b0d953f8ec6ef48df onto dorina](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5518)

- [feat: add config option for maximum number of client connections](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5513)

- [IPR request types v8](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5498): Bump IPR request/response types to v8

- [Support static routes for HTTP requests](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5487)

- [added missing import to doctest](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5480)

- [adjusted TestSetup::new_complex to ensure bonded node's existence](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5478)

- [Trigger contracts CI on main workspace Cargo changes](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5477): since the contracts workspace depends on the common code in the main workspace, and since the contracts are critical to not have regressions in, trigger contracts CI on any changes to the workspace Cargo.toml and lock files.

- [Run cargo autoinherit](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5460): run `cargo autoinherit` to move a bunch of dependencies to the workspace level. `Cargo.lock` remains untouched.

- [Disable debug in wasm and wallet workflows too](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5459)

- [Fix clippy::precedence](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5457): fix clippy warnings for the Rust beta toolchain.

- [Provide Interval context with node descriptor endpoints](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5456): add current interval context information to existing enpoints using `build_skimmed_nodes_response` under the hood. This allows clients checking for a refresh to send the `epoch_uid` as a query parameter when fetching updates so the server can tell it that there have been no changes, instead of sending duplicate data over and over. The changes in this PR should be backwards compatible and never interfere with existing clients. The additions to the `NodeParams` are optional, so there is no error if a client does not send them. Old clients will not send `epoch_uid` by accident so they cannot accidentally clear their set of known nodes. In the response the status field is optional so if it is missing (e.g. if a new client talks to an old server) the connection still works. For old clients speaking to new servers, the json parsing will simply ignore extra information not included in the objects json spec.

<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>

 Made a request to the `/api/v1/unstable/nym-nodes/semi-skimmed` endpoint:
 - without entering an epoch_id
 - with entering the current epoch_id
 - with entering an old epoch_id
 - with entering a future epoch_id
 All results returned the same data, as expected

</AccordionTemplate>

- [Feature/add gbp currency](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5453)

- [Add helper to extract a list of sqlite files with journal files wal/shm](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5452)

- [Add a middleware layer to the nym api allowing for data compression](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5451): after Testing in a minimal example, this does work as expected. Routes still default to plain encoding, however if a client indicates support for a compressed encoding using the `Accept-Encoding` header then the served response will be compressed with the appropriate `Content-Encoding` header. ([Proof-of-Concept](https://gist.github.com/jmwample/c15a983e804fc338fee3d1b037d216b0))

<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
 Sent requests with and without Accept-Encoding: gzip to observe response behaviour
 Verified if responses included content-encoding: gzip when compression was requested
 Checked response file output to confirm actual compression occurred
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Condense core API functionalities and enable gzip decompression for reqwest payloads](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5450): this PR is intended to take out variables from our usage of HTTP requests in the `nym-http-api-client`. To do this the PR: (1) adds the `ApiClientCore` trait with the minimal feature required to send a request, (2) turns all request sending into trait extension automatically implemented for any type that implements `ApiClientCore`. This has the benefit of consistent expected behavior for all clients using `nym-http-api-client`, including features added going forward. FOR EXAMPLE this pr adds a default header `"accept-encoding: gzip;q=1.0, *;q=0.5"` which indicates that compression is preferred whenever available. Other features to keep in mind here are things like configurable retries, domain fallbacks, etc. Note: the `Apiclient` interface could be simplified, but that would require refactoring our downstream usages of the API. For now this isn't necessary as `ApiClient` is implemented automatically so it costs nothing to have it this way. It just allows divergent usage in downstream crates.

<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
 Measured nym-api response times before and after updating the API client using curl
 Checked if the client automatically decompressed Gzip responses
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Seedable clients](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5440): Adds `DerivationMaterial` and accompanying methods to builders. `DerivationMaterial` encapsulates parameters for deterministic key derivation using HKDF (SHA-512). Use the `derive_secret()` method to generate a 32-byte secret. To prepare for a new derivation, call the `next()` method which increments the index. **It is the caller's responsibility to track and persist the derivation index if keys need to be rederived.**

<AccordionTemplate name="Example">

 ```rust
 let master_key = [0u8; 32]; // your secret master key
 let salt = "unique-salt-value".to_string();
 let material = DerivationMaterial::new(master_key, 0, salt.as_bytes());

 // Derive a secret
 let secret = material.derive_secret().expect("Failed to derive secret");

 // Prepare for the next derivation
 let next_material = material.next();
 ```

</AccordionTemplate>

- [Remove all recv_with_delay and add shutdown condition to loops in client-core](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5435): inside client-core we want to prepare the ground for moving a behaviour close to what we have in the vpn client. Remove all the recv_with_delay since we want to just stop. Add shutdown condition to all select loops to guard against the shutdown listener being polled inside the select blocks. Remove unwraps when sending on unbounded channels in case the receiver exits before the sender. Move `TaskClient` to be a member field so make it easier to wrap log errors in a shutdown check. Update all fork names to use underscore consistently, since the task separator is hyphen

<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
 Validated that all binaries including `nym-node`, `nym-client`, `nym-network-requester`, and `nym-socks5-client` are behaving well without indicating the presence of any unexpected errors or crashes
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Disable the test for checking the remaining bandwidth in nym-node-status-api](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5425): this check fails almost every time on CI, possibly due to rate limiting? It's not good to disable the check, but it's blocking CI as it stands now. Given that we have the check above for locating the ip, we at least have a little coverage.

- [Dz nym node stats](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5418): removed obsolete fields from stats (blacklisted mixnodes, blacklisted gateways, bonded mixnodes, bonded gateways). Introduced nym-node scraping, beside just mixnodes. `/mixnodes/stats` now returns data for nym-nodes as well, which results in much more accurate "packets mixed" stats.

- Accepted participants are expected to run their nodes in assigned location and with [new specs](#service-grant-program-v2) by February 28th the latest.
- Squads orchestrating multiple nodes will be prioritized in locations with more slots.
- There is no final budget, neither a size per node as we expect that the next round of Service Grants program will be individual grants of varying sizes, depending on how many nodes, location, specs etc.
- Every participant of SGPv1 can submit for SGPv2 as many nodes as they currently have grant for, more slots may be offered later on.
- New submissions can only do one node per operator unless people come in squads (or DAOs) and can orchestrate multiple nodes on larger dedicated servers.
- Actual locations and approximate slots are listed below. If you want to have a node in a location which is not listed but it's near by some of the listed ones, it's not a problem, be honest in the form so we know where you planning to run nodes.
- February is the last month we proceed with grants under SGPv1.

##### How to Join

1. Have a look at the remaining [locations](#locations), specs and providers. You can contact them directly and make a calculation how much running a node on their service would cost and what size of a grant you expect to receive.
2. To apply for a service grant, the first step is to fill in [this form](https://nymtech2.typeform.com/to/LyPJer49) per each node.
3. Be responsive on Element for follow up communication.

##### Locations

These locations and slots are approximate and constantly change based on new operators submissions. Please keep in mind that we are going to chose people with respect to empty slots in the given location at the time of their submission. In case of competing submissions in the same location we will take the one with better specs vs price ratio.

### Features

- [DNS resolver configuration for internal HTTP client lookups](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5355): The resolver itself is the set combination of the google, cloudflare, and quad9 endpoints supporting DoH, DoT, and for google DoH3 as well. This resolver implements a fallback mechanism where, should the DNS-over-X resolution fail, a followup resolution will be done using the hosts configured default (e.g. `/etc/resolve.conf` on linux).

- [Bump tokio from `1.40.0` to `1.43.0`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5370)

- [Uncouple storage reference for bandwidth client](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5372): Because of the `Storage` reference in the bandwidth client, the client can't be separated and used in a different place, as it will be linked to the `DisconnectedClient`. Cloning it ensures we uncouple this unnecessary dependence.

- [`MixnetClient` can send `ClientRequests`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5381): Adding a channel to the `MixnetClient`, so that it can signal to the `MixTrafficController` that can send a `ClientRequest` via its `GatewayTransciver`. Additionaly adds a sleep to the `disconnect` call as the socket would close before the channel message got processed.

- [Use secure DNS for websocket connection establishment](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5386): Adjust the websocket connection establishment (using `tokio_tungstenite`) to use a custom DNS resolver that tries DoH and DoT. Instead of relying on the `tokio_tungstenite` to open the `tokio::net::TcpStream` ([which it does here](https://github.com/snapview/tokio-tungstenite/blob/aafb2f9e036162f7bffa002cfea502376a690724/src/connect.rs#L91)) which would kick in the default network resolver we do the resolution and open the `TcpStream` ourselves before handing off to the websocket libary.

- [Reduce log severity for checking topology validity](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5395)

- [Change Explorer URL to new smooshed nodes](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5396)

- [Send shutdown instead of panic when reaching max fail](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5398): Remove a panic and an unwrap inside `client-core` that is hit occasionally in the vpn client. This is a change that can have wide ranging impact since it changes the task handling and it's inside `client-core`, which is used in many components and services, so preventing regressions is important.

- [Relocate a validator api function](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5401): Adds a function to the `nym-validator-client` crate that hits the network details endpoint and returns an object parsed from `json`. This was floating loose in the `nym-vpn-client` repo.

- [Bump the patch-updates group across 1 directory with 9 updates](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5406)

- [Upgrade to `thiserror` 2.0](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5414)

- [Make `wait_for_graceful_shutdown` to be pub](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5424)

- [Fix statistics shutdown](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5426)

- [Push down forget me to client configs](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5431)

### Bugfix

- [Fix missing path triggers for CI](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5380): Fix missing path triggers for CI and sort crate list alphabetically to make it easier to maintain.

### Operators Updates & Tools

<Callout type="info">
From `nym-node v1.3.0` operators can technically choose multiple functionalities for their `nym-node` binary (flagged as `--mode`).

**However, the clients are yet to be developed to be able to make a proper selection for multi-mode nodes!**

**WE ASK OPERATORS TO ASSIGN ONLY ONE FUNCTIONALITY TO `--mode` OPTION PER NODE. PLEASE SELECT ONE MODE ARGUMENT OUT OF: `mixnode` or `entry-gateway` or `exit-gateway`!**
</Callout>

- Updated maintenance guides to [backup](nodes/maintenance#backup-a-node), [restore](nodes/maintenance#restoring-a-node) and [move](nodes/maintenance#moving-a-node) a node, containing a new and important commands to backup and restore `clients.sqlite` database.

- [New explanation of `nym-node` functionalities](nodes/nym-node/setup#functionality-mode) describing how Gateways get selected in Mixnet mode and Wireguard mode.

<Callout type="warning">
Wireguard nodes route data directly to the open internet. Therefore it exposes IP of operators server (VPS) to abuse complains. Before you decide to run a node with active wireguard routing, please read our [Community Counsel pages](community-counsel/exit-gateway) containing more information and some legal content.

**Wireguard mode has no exit policy right now - we are working on the implementation.**
</Callout>

#### Legal support

We have been notified that a handful of nodes have been taken down by abuse reports. We created new pages with [legal suggestions](community-counsel/legal) and email [templates](community-counsel/templates). Here are some useful points on legal support:

- Here is the first version of a response template tailored for Nym operators.
<AccordionTemplate name="Email template: responding to DMCA take-down notices">
<AbuseResponse />
</AccordionTemplate>

- We are starting Operators Legal Clinic with Alexis Roussel, every Wednesday, 14:30 UTC (60 min) in our [Operator Legal Forum channel on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!YfoUFsJjsXbWmijbPG:nymtech.chat?via=nymtech.chat&via=matrix.org&via=matrix.su4ka.icu). Come and share your findigs and questions with the rest of the operators.

- Join [Operator Legal Forum channel](https://matrix.to/#/!YfoUFsJjsXbWmijbPG:nymtech.chat?via=nymtech.chat&via=matrix.org&via=matrix.su4ka.icu) and share as much as possible (like screen prints, provider, location etc).

- Join [Community legal counsel](https://nym.com/docs/operators/community-counsel) - our collective knowledge hub. Add your findings by opening a [Pull Request](https://nym.com/docs/operators/add-content)

- While we are working on a new list of more friendly providers, consider to move away from these provides as soon as possible:

    - Servinga / VPS2day (AS39378)
    - Frantech / Ponynet / BuyVM (AS53667)
    - OVH SAS / OVHcloud (AS16276)
    - Online S.A.S. / Scaleway (AS12876)
    - Hetzner Online GmbH (AS24940)
    - IONOS SE (AS8560)
    - Psychz Networks (AS40676)
    - 1337 Services GmbH / RDP.sh (AS210558)

- Backup your nodes to have access to `.nym` directory locally. Follow [node](nodes/maintenance#backup-a-node) and [proxy configuration](nodes/maintenance#backup-proxy-configuration) backup guides to be able to [restore your node](nodes/maintenance#restoring-a-node) later on on another machine, without losing your delegation.

- We would like to ask operators who use reverse proxy and a domain (required for Gateways) to start using a common convention starting with `nym-exit` for their nodes URL. The entire address should have this new format:
```
nym-exit.<CUSTOM>.<DOMAIN>.<TLD>
```

For example:

```
# for squads running multiple nodes a format can look like this:
nym-exit.ch-node1.mysquad.org

# or like this
nym-exit.3-jamaica.mysquad.org

# for operators having one node per location, the format can look like this:
nym-exit.brazil.mysquad.org

# or if operators decide to not have any custom, they can simply have this format:
nym-exit.mysquad.org
```

**The `NYM-EXIT` part in the beginning is what's important.**

- When registering a domain, check [Top Level Domain (TLD)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1348/top-level-domain-tld) terms and conditions. For example `.icu` is a no go. Having a wrong TLD may lead to your domain being taken away from you when facing a DMCA report.

- Write a message to your provider and introduce your intention to run a Nym Node on their service
<AccordionTemplate name="Email template: Introduce yourself to your VPS provider">
<OperatorIntroduction />
</AccordionTemplate>

- New page with [templates for VPS provider](community-counsel/templates)

#### Delegation Program

**If you are interested to sign up to delegation program que, message Merve on Element for the time being as we are working on CRM upgrade. We review nodes dynamically and delegate to new ones once a month.** New operators interested to join DP must follow the rules specified [here](https://delegations.explorenym.net/), run one of two latest binary version and have [Terms & Conditions](nodes/nym-node/setup#terms--conditions) accepted.

Note: Due to the token price we allow operators to have Operators cost 1000 NYM, the profit margin maximum remains 20%.

**Delegation and undelegation in January**

Delegated to all these nodes:

#### Service Grant Program v2

Aside from delegating on top of nodes, Nym runs a Service Grant Program (SGP) to support Exit Gateway operators before they will be rewarded by collecting [zk-nym tickets](../network/cryptography/zk-nym) from users subscription. Operators included in SGP are long term active community members with the highest requirements on the technical setup and upgrading pace. We are about to start a second iteration of SGP very soon (SGPv2). The final slots and locations are yet to be concluded. Priority to participate in SGPv2 will be given to the current operators in SGP. Based on the number of slots, we will then determine how many more operators can sign up.

##### Rules of SGPv2

<Callout type="info">
**We will share more info soon in the channels. The rules are not set in stone and could potentially be altered or updated in the future! Do *not* purchase new servers neither migrate your nodes just yet.**
</Callout>

As we finalising last details of *"Project Smoosh"*, where one binary - `nym-node` - can run as an `entry-gateway`, `mixnode` or `exit-gateway` in Mixnet mode as well as `entry-gateway` or `exit-gateway` in Wireguard mode, we plan to step up the game. SGPv2 grants will be higher if operators can meet new requirements.

**Minimum Specs & Requirements**

These are minimum requirements to become a part of SGPv2. We aim to have nodes on dedicated servers, with exceptions for much stronger VPS to meet the needed criteria while sharing server with other users.

**Operators interested in joining SGPv2 can start by searching for servers that meet the above criteria, where they may eventually migrate their nodes, and then share their findings by submitting a form which will be shared shortly. Do *not* buy a new server, neither migrate a node just yet! We will be first reaching to the current participants of Service Grant Program. Everything will be announced, sending DMs to devrel will not speed up the process!**


### Features

- [build(deps): bump criterion from `0.4.0` to `0.5.1`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4911): Bumps [criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) from `0.4.0` to `0.5.1`.

- [NS API: add mixnet scraper](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5200)

- [build(deps): bump http from `1.1.0` to `1.2.0`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5228): Bumps [http](https://github.com/hyperium/http) from `1.1.0` to `1.2.0`.

- [`http-api-client`: deduplicate code](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5267): After adding PATCH support in [\#5260](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5260), it's now time to de-duplicate some of the code

- [Add windows to CI builds](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5269)

- [nym topology revamp](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5271): This PR changes the internals of the `NymTopology` to blur the lines between explicit mixnodes and gateways so that what used to be considered a "mixnode" could be a valid egress point of the network. `NymTopology` is no longer divided into `BTreeMap<MixLayer, Vec<mix::Node>>` and `Vec<gateway::Node>`. instead there's information about the current rewarded set (to support future VRF work) and a simple map of `HashMap<NodeId, RoutingNode>`. The new features are mostly controlled via 2 new flags/config values:
    - `use_extended_topology` that tells the client to retrieve **all** network nodes rather than the ones that got assigned "active" mixnode role (or support being a gateway)
    - `ignore_egress_epoch_role` that tells the client it's  fine to construct egress packets to nodes that are **not** assigned entry or exit gateway role

- [Nyx Chain Watcher](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5274)

- [Include `IPINFO_API_TOKEN` in nightly CI](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5285)

- [Move tun constants to network defaults](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5286):
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
1. **Regression Testing**:
- Verified no issues arose when running tests for the affected files.
- Tested TUN behaviour with new nym-nodes in the hu branch.

**Results**:

- **No bugs detected**.
- Tunnels are functioning as expected, with traffic routing and IP generation working seamlessly.
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Add dependabot assignes for the root cargo ecosystem](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5297)

- [build(deps): bump the patch-updates group across 1 directory with 35 updates](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5310): Bumps the `patch-updates` group with 33 updates

- [Periodically remove stale gateway messages](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5312): This PR introduces a simple task that removes gateway messages that haven't been retrieved in (by default) 24h.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
**Automation Script for Data Cleanup Validation**

Test Objective: Validate that the stale message cleanup mechanism in the database correctly removes records older than the configured threshold (24 hours).

Test Setup:
1. Environment:
    * SQLite database
    * Bash script: used to insert data.

Steps Performed:
1. Ran the insert_data.sh script to populate the database with test data:
    * Recent records inserted successfully.
2. Verified the database content post-insertion: sqlite3 clients.sqlite "SELECT * FROM message_store;"
3. Confirmed that all 20 records (10 recent + 10 stale) were present.
4. Allowed the system to run for 24 hours to trigger the cleanup mechanism.
5. Queried the database again after 24 hours: sqlite3 gateway_storage.db "SELECT * FROM message_store;"
6.

 Expected Result:
* All stale records (older than 24 hours) should be removed.
* Recent records should remain in the database.
Actual Result:
* Query after 24 hours showed only the 10 recent records.
* All 10 stale records were successfully removed.

- [Use expect in geodata test to give error message on failure](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5314): Keep hitting this error on CI, from what I think is network hickup. But it's hard to tell form the log since the error is swallowed.  Explicitly unwrap the result so we get a more detailed error output.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
**Quick Code Review**

**Summary**
1. **CI Workflow**: Adjusted paths to optimise build triggers, avoiding unnecessary CI runs while ensuring coverage for key directories
2. **Geolocation Test**: Improved error handling by replacing assertions with `.expect` for clearer debugging in API regression tests

**Conclusion**

Regression testing confirms everything works as intended. **Approved**.

- [`CancellationToken`-based shutdowns](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5325): This PR introduces scaffolding for using `CancellationToken` and `TaskTracker` for our graceful shutdowns rather than the existing `TaskClient` and `TaskManager`.

- [Introduce `/load` endpoint for self-reported quantised Nym Node load](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5326): This PR introduces a new `/load` endpoint on a `NymNode` to return its current load. It returns the following data:
```rust
pub struct NodeLoad {
    pub total: Load,
    pub machine: Load,
    pub network: Load,
}
```
Where `Load` is quantised into the following buckets / tiers:
```rust
pub enum Load {
    Negligible, // 0 - 0.1
    Low,        // 0.1 - 0.3
    Medium,     // 0.3 - 0.6
    High,       // 0.6 - 0.8
    VeryHigh,   // 0.8 - 0.95
    AtCapacity, // >= 0.95
}
```
<AccordionTemplate name={<LoadEndpointInfo/>}>
The actual values  for`NodeLoad` are determined as follows:
- For network we approximate current rx/tx rates on all `eth` interfaces and scale them to the range of 0-1Gbps (for this initial iteration we assume the maximum network speed is 1Gbps which would be treated as fully saturated). So for example, if the node is sending at 0.5Gbps, it would get a `Load` of 0.5 and thus value of `Load::Medium`, 0.9Gbps would get `Load` of 0.9 and value of `Load::VeryHigh`, etc. we take the bigger value between rx and tx
- For machine load there's a bit more logic in there:
    - Firstly we determine what I call a "base load" of the machine. we do this by taking the average load from the last 5min (via `getloadavg`) and dividing it by the number of CPUs in the machine. For example if the average load of the machine in the last 5min was `1.23` and it has 2 CPUs, then it's `Load` would be `Load::High` (`1.23 / 2 = 0.615`)
    - However, whilst CPU utilisation is one of the most important factors, it does not tell the whole story. I tried to also take memory/swap utilisation into consideration (whilst not making it the main factor)
    - Thus we calculate two additional auxiliary `Load` values, for memory usage and swap usage, i.e.: `used_memory / total_memory` and `used_swap / total_swap` respectively.
    - Then we check whether either of the `MemoryLoad` or `SwapLoad` is bigger than the current base `Load` of the machine we have determined, if so, it's increased by one tier / bucket. For example, say the current machine load is `Load::Low`, but the memory usage is at 90% (`Load::VeryHigh`). that would result in the reported `Load` being bumped up to `Load::Medium` instead. The same logic applies with swap load, **however, only if the total swap > 1GB**. this is to prevent weird edge cases where the machine has hardly any swap.
    - Finally, the `.total` `Load` uses the same "tier bumping" behaviour using the `.total` and `.network` loads, i.e. `if network > machine`, then `total = machine + 1`. for example if `machine` `Load` is `Load::Low`, but `network` `Load` is `Load::Medium`, then the `total` `Load` is set to `Load::Medium` instead.

**IPv4 Configuration and Migration Testing**

Testing Steps:
- Initiated and ran a nym-node with version 1.3.1 on an IPv4-only machine, then updated it to the new 'hu', 1.4.0 version.
- Initiated and ran a new nym-node with 'hu', 1.4.0 always on a machine with only IPv4.
- Initiated and ran a new nym-node with 'hu', 1.4.0 on a machine with both IPv4 and IPv6 for regression testing.

Results:
- No functional issues during version updates.
- Logged message on all versions: "no registered client for destination: ff02::2"

### Operators Updates & Tools

<Callout type="info">
From `nym-node v1.3.0` operators can choose multiple functionalities for their `nym-node` binary (flagged as `--mode`).

**However, the clients are yet to be developed to be able to make a proper selection for multi-mode nodes and therefore we ask operators to sign only one functionality to `--mode` option at a time. Please chose out of: `mixnode` or `entry-gateway` or `exit-gateway`.**

We are developing a design where operators can enable multiple modes, and let the Nym API to position the node according the network's needs in the beginning of each epoch.

### Features

- [build(deps): bump micromatch from `4.0.4` to `4.0.8` in `/testnet-faucet`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4813): Bumps [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) from `4.0.4` to `4.0.8`.
- [Move NS client to separate package under NS API](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5171):
    - Moving NS API client code to separate package outside NS Agent makes the code cleaner & more modular
    - NS agent now imports NS API client that it uses
    - No functionality change in NS API or NS agent
- [Introduced initial internal commands for nym-cli: ecash key and request generation](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5174)
- [NS API - Gateway stats scraping](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5180): This PR adds a metrics scraper that fetches metrics from the `metrics/sessions` endpoint on gateway. The entries are stored and served on the API for one year
- [Remove explorer dependency](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5190)
- [Hopefully final steps of the smoosh™️](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5201): this PR is a bit more extensive than initially planned because of all the spaghetti that had to be untangled to make it all happen. The general idea is that now it's possible to run your node simultaneously in multiple modes. for example `mixnode` + `entry` or `entry` + `exit`, etc. The modes do the following:
    - `mixnode`: allows the node to handle **forward** sphinx packets
    - `entry-gateway`: allows the node to accepts websocket connections from incoming clients and to handle **final hop** sphinx packets
    - `exit-gateway`: allows the node to handle **final hop** sphinx packets as well as starts NR and IPR service providers
    Furthermore, if node runs with `wireguard` enabled, it will start local `authenticator` service provider which will also implicitly enable final hop packet handling regardless of the underlying mode. There are also various of other smaller (and bigger) changes:
    - Upon receiving a forward packet, its delay is now clamped so that one could not dos the node by asking it to delay it for, for example, a year
    - As mentioned above, node can now run in multiple modes at the same time,
    - `/metrics/mixing` endpoint got deprecated (it still provides the same information, however) and might be removed in future release
    - Introduced `/metrics/packet-stats` endpoint that provides more extensive information about packets received/sent
    - It is now possible to control whether the node should log its statistics to console
    - The console logs are also updated with the current packet rates
    - All nodes now run the "verloc" protocol and measure every other node on the network
    - Metrics got revamped and unified:
    - All running metrics are stored in a single `NymNodeMetrics` struct
    - There exists a `MetricsAggregator` that listens to any metrics events that might require additional processing
    - Any new metrics event types can be easily added by registering a new handler via `register_handler`. the type must implement `MetricsHandler` trait and use unique variant of `MetricsEvent` enum. for example `GatewaySessionStatsHandler`. It is, however, possible to have opaque handlers, such as the already implemented `LegacyMixingStatsUpdater` and `MixnetMetricsCleaner`
    - Everything in `mixnode` directory has been removed because there was nothing really left there. The mixing socket listener was unified in `nym-node` and similarly `verloc` was also moved there
    - `gateway` directory was similarly reduced in size. Now it also creates appropriate tasks as opposed to the whole gateway process. eventually it might also be further stripped, but today is not that day.
    - Removed the generic parameter on the `GatewayStorage` to simplify all the generics down the stack. it wasn't used anyway

CLI:
    - Added `--modes` argument to specify all node modes with a single command (or `env` variable). for example: `--modes="mixnode,entry"`. Can't be used alongside `--modes`
    - Extended `--mode` argument to allow specifying it multiple times, for example: `--mode mixnode --mode entry`. can't be used alongside `--mode`

Config changes:
    - Replaced `mode` with `modes` to allow setting the node to run with say, `entry` + `mixnode` roles simultaneously
    - Added `maximum_forward_packet_delay` to `mixnet.debug` section
    - Moved `verloc` section from `mixnode.verloc` to top level
    - Removed `mixnode` section
    - Removed `entry_gateway` section to `gateway_tasks`
    - Moved `authenticator` section from `gateway_tasks` (`entry_gateway`) to `service_providers` (`exit_gateway`)
    - Renamed `exit_gateway` section to `service_providers`
    - Moved top level `authenticator` section to `service_providers` so that it'd live alongside NR and IPR
    - Added general `debug` section
    - Added `metrics` section

- [[Product Data] Introduce data persistence on gateways](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5022): This PR builds on top of [\#4974](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4974), not changing the behavior of the data collection, but persisting them in a sqlite database so they can be kept across restarts and crashes. It also leave the door open for other stats module to use that storage if needed. Here are some points of interest:
    - New [`gateway_stats_storage`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/simon/gateway_stats_persistence/common/gateway-stats-storage) crate
    - [Config migration](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/simon/gateway_stats_persistence/nym-node/src/config/old_configs/old_config_v4.rs) resulting from the added database.
    - Resulting changes in the [`statistics`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/simon/gateway_stats_persistence/gateway/src/node/statistics) module to account the new storage system

- [[Product Data] Client-side stats collection ](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5107): The goal is to anonymously gather stats from nym-clients. These stats will be sent through the mixnet to a Nym run service provider that will gather them. This PR sets the scene to send stats in a mixnet message to an address. The address can be set when the client is created. Current stats include some infos on sent packets along with platform information. If a receiving address is set, the client will send a mixnet packet every 5min to this address. Otherwise, nothing happens and the client runs as usual.

It can be set in the config file, as a CLI argument and as an env var in a `.env` file. As the stats reporting config in now in the `DebugConfig`, the `StatsReportingConfig` is no longer required, making the propagation of these changes more readable

- [config score](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5117): introduces a concept of a `config_score` to a nym node which influences performance and thus rewarding amounts and chances of being in the rewarded set. Currently it's influenced by the following factors:
    - Accepting terms and conditions (not accepted: 0)
    - Exposing self-described API (not exposed: 0)
    - Running "nym-node" binary (legacy binary: 0)
    - Number of versions behind the core (`score = 0.995 ^ (X * versions_behind ^ 1.65)`)
    - The old performance is now treated as `routing_score`
    - the "new" performance = `routing_score * config_score`

### Operators Updates & Tools

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
**Nym Network will now only allow nodes which [migrated](nodes/nym-node/bonding#migrate-to-nym-node-in-mixnet-smart-contract) their node in Nym mixnet smart contract to Nym Node. All nodes which are still bonded as a legacy one (Mixnode or Gateway) in the wallet will have no chance to take part in the [Rewarded set selection](tokenomics/mixnet-rewards#rewarded-set-selection).**

**Operators taking part in Delegation program or Service Grant program must migrate their nodes latest by December 16th, 08:00 UTC.**
</Callout>

#### Updates

- [Version count as a part of config score](tokenomics/mixnet-rewards#config-score-calculation) has been introduced. To familiarize yourself with Nym Node operator rewards calculation, read [this page](tokenomics/mixnet-rewards).
- Nym nodes running as Exit Gateway in Service Grant program received delegation. Nym team is now delegating total of **64,800,000 NYM on top 241 Nym Nodes** (137 in Mixnode mode and 104 as Gateways). Our delegation aims to incentivise committed operators who support bootstrapping of Nym network before paying users come.

<br />

<AccordionTemplate name="Delegation size for Gateways in SGP">
- 250k NYM - Upgrading to magura in time - 2 nodes
- 300k NYM - Upgrading to magura + bonus for a quick patch upgrade - 102 nodes
- No delegation - not upgrading in time - 2 nodes
</AccordionTemplate>

- `nym-node` has now implemented [IPv6 support for wireguard](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5059)

- [`network_tunnel_manager.sh` updated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nymtech/nym/refs/heads/develop/scripts/network_tunnel_manager.sh): run the commands below to make sure

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
After changes coming along with `v2024.13-magura` (`nym-node v1.1.10`), Nym Explorer is no longer picking all values correctly. Instead of fixing this outdated explorer, we are working on a new one, coming out soon.

[Nym Harbourmaster](https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net) has cache of 90min, expect your values to be updated with delay. We are aware of some issues with Nym Harbourmaster and working hard to resolve them in the upcoming explorer v2. To check your routing values in real time, you can use [`nym-gateway-probe`](nodes/performance-and-testing/gateway-probe).
</Callout>

### Operators Updates & Tools

- Updated [`network_tunnel_manager.sh`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/scripts/network_tunnel_manager.sh) (moved to our monorepo) helps operators to configure their IP tables rules for `nymtun` and `wireguard` routing.

- **Please re-run [routing configuration steps](nodes/nym-node/configuration#routing-configuration) to update your routing settings.**

- We found out that some operators have a wrong value for wireguard IP. Follow these steps to ensure your value is set to `10.1.0.1` (default on new nodes):

<Steps>
###### 1. Open your node config file:
```sh
nano $HOME/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/config/config.toml

# change <ID> for your local nym moniker for example:
# nano $HOME/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/config/config.toml
```
###### 2. Control or change the value of wireguard private IP
- Scroll down to section starting with `[wireguard]`
- Find line `private_ip` and ensure it's set to value `10.1.0.1`
- The section will look like this:
```toml
[wireguard]
# Specifies whether the wireguard service is enabled on this node.
enabled = true

# Socket address this node will use for binding its wireguard interface.
# default: `0.0.0.0:51822`
bind_address = '0.0.0.0:51822'

# Private IP address of the wireguard gateway.
# default: `10.1.0.1`
private_ip = '10.1.0.1'
```
###### 3. Save, exit and restart the service
- If you used `nano` editor - press `ctrl` + `x` and confirm the changes
- Run these commands to update the service with new values and restart your node process:
```sh
systemctl daemon-reload && service nym-node restart
```
</Steps>

- New manual how to [run `nym-node` as non-root](nodes/nym-node/configuration#running-nym-node-as-a-non-root)

- Since `v2024.13-magura`, operators do not update their node version in the wallet. [Manual upgrading steps](nodes/maintenance/manual-upgrade.mdx) has been updated accordingly.

- CLI tool `node_api_check.py`, helping operators to collect all API values about their nodes locally, is not up to date with the API changes introduced with `v2024.13-magura` release version. Please treat it as unstable before we fix it.

#### Error Log

In case you encounter this error:
```
[ERROR] nym-node/src/node/mod.rs:628: the exit gateway subtask has failed with the following message: failed to start authenticator: internal wireguard error no private IP set for peer..
```

You can follow these steps to make a workaround:

<br />

<AccordionTemplate name="Authenticator error fix">
<Steps>
###### 1. Find the error

- In the node logs, locate the ERROR message which says `the exit gateway subtask has failed with the following message: failed to start authenticator: internal wireguard error no private IP set for peer KN5GPvkC+p6G/SM4PD2Z3ObAtRGiDjHPRnQOPpbdUQk=`

- Copy the end part of that peer, later denoted as `<WG_PEER_STRING_END>` (in our example `GiDjHPRnQOPpbdUQk=`) to use later in the sql commands

###### 2. Fix the issue in sqlite3 db

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Be careful when running commands within sqlite database.
</Callout>

- Navigate to the data directory:
```sh
cd $HOME/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/data
```
- Enter the database:
```sh
sqlite3 clients.sqlite
```

- Run these commands:
```sh
# Change with your unique <PEER_STRING_END>
select * from wireguard_peer where public_key like "%<WG_PEER_STRING_END>%"
# Make sure that only ONE line is returned and it contains the key

delete from wireguard_peer where public_key like "%<WG_PEER_STRING_END>%";
```
- Confirm that peer has been removed by running this again:
```sh
select * from wireguard_peer where public_key like "%<WG_PEER_STRING_END>%";
```

###### 3. Exit and restart the service

Run `.quit` and:
```sh
systemctl restart nym-node.service
```
</Steps>

</AccordionTemplate>

- [V2 performance monitoring feature flag](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4943): Feature flag to use v2 network monitor results in rewarding

- [Add `utoipa` feature to nym-node](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4945): `cargo build -p nym-node` was failing, since its depending on `QueryParams` having `utoipa` traits derived

- [Ticket type storage](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4947)

- [`nym-api` container](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4948)

- [Extract packet processing from mixnode-common](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4949): First step on a journey of making a strong interface around packet processing, and packet processing portability. This one only moves stuff around, so it should be safe to just blindly merge.

- [expose authenticator address along other address in node-details](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4953): Expose authenticator address along ip packet router and network requester for easier parsing

- [Feature/contract state tools](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4954): Introduced/reimplemented old tools for importing cosmwasm contract states given a kv dump file. This makes it significantly easier to plan and test complex state migrations on actual chains where we risk timing out on expensive operations.

- [Add env feature to clap and make clap parameters available as env variables](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4957)

- [Bump sqlx to 0.7.4](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4959)

- [`Product Data` First step in gateway usage data collection](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4963): This PR is the first step towards collecting data on gateway usage. It builds up on an old code for what was then nym-connect. It exposes unique users count and connection time histogram on the `metrics/sessions` endpoint of the self-described API on entry-gateways. For the time being, data is collected by probing the `ActiveClientStore` every minute and extracting data from this. Data is stored internally and exposed on the next day, i.e. UTC day $d$ exposes data from day $d-1$. The [`statistics`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/simon/product_data/gateway/src/node/statistics) module will evolve as we add collection for product data and censorship resistance study. The collection will also eventually switch from probing to event-based for more accurate data.

- [`importer-cli` to correctly handle mixnet/vesting import](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4966)

- [Import `nym-vpn-api` crates](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4967): Keep these crates in a separate workspace for now. The idea is to add them to the main workspace in time, but this appears to might require some changes to how sqlite is used. Alternatively these issues might go away once we upgrade sqlite in the main workspace. Also we intend to rename some of these to something like `nym-credential-facade`, and the wasm lib should be incorporated in one of the existing crates in `common`.

- [chore: remove unused rocket code](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4968)

- [add Dockerfile for nym node](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4972)

- [`Product Data` Add session type based on ecash ticket received](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4974): Fire an `EcashTicket` event for the `GatewayStatisticsCollector`, when an Ecash ticket is being accepted. This allows to mark an active session as being a mixnet session or a vpn session. It also changes the format of the related self-described data, to accommodate that new session type.

- Nodes bonded with vesting tokens are [not allowed to join rewarded set](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/5129) - read more on [Nym operators forum](https://forum.nymtech.net/t/vesting-accounts-are-no-longer-supported/827)

#### Wallet changes

**[New wallet version 1.2.15](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/tag/nym-wallet-v1.2.15) is out!**

- [New wallet changelog](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-wallet-v1.2.15/nym-wallet/CHANGELOG.md)

- This version of wallet allows and prompts operators to migrate their gateway or mixnode to a `nym-node` in the Mixnet smart contract - an important step in [project smoosh](archive/faq/smoosh-faq.mdx). To do so follow these steps:

<br />
<AccordionTemplate name="Steps to use wallet for node migration">
<Steps>

###### 1. Download the wallet from [the release page](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/tag/nym-wallet-v1.2.15)

###### 2. Verify the binary and extract it if needed

- Download [`hashes.json`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/download/nym-wallet-v1.2.15/hashes.json)
- Open it with your text editor or print it's content with `cat hashes.json`
- Run `sha256sum <WALLET_BINARY>` for example `sha256sum ./nym-wallet_1.2.15_amd64.AppImage`
- If your have to extract it (like `.tar.gz`) do it

###### 3. Open the wallet and sign in

###### 4. Migrate!

- Go to Bonding and you will be prompted with such message:

![](/images/operators/wallet-screenshots/migrate_nym-node.png)

- In case you for some reason didn't see the prompt or you closed it - you can click in the upper right corner of the same window on this button:

![](/images/operators/wallet-screenshots/migrate_nym-node2.png)

- Confirm the transaction

###### 5. Welcome to new episode of `nym-node`!

</ Steps>
</AccordionTemplate>

- **Older versions will not allow bonding new nodes!**



#### Selection & Rewarding

- **Config score is introduced:** In the current version the nodes selection to the active set has a new parameter (which multiplies the existing formula) - `config_score`. Config score looks if the node binary is `nym-node` (not legacy `nym-mixnode` or `nym-gateway`) **AND** if [Terms & Conditions](nodes/nym-node/setup.mdx#terms--conditions) are accepted. Config score has binary values of either 0 or 1, with a following logic:

| **Run `nym-node` binary** | **T&C's accepted** | **`config_score`** |
| :--                       | :--                | ---:               |
| True                      | False              | 0                  |
| False                     | True               | 0                  |
| False                     | False              | 0                  |
| True                      | True               | 1                  |

- The active set selection formula is then:
> CONFIG_SCORE \* STAKE_SATURATION \* PERFORMANCE ^ 20

- Currently in *Native rewarding*, the rewards are split equally across the [rewarded set of nodes](https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/epoch/reward_params) (which now = active set and it's size is 240 nodes) for both Mixnet mode and dVPN mode. Every node being assigned 1 / 240 work factor (hence *naive rewarding*).

#### Directory Services v2.1: API & Mixnet Contract Changes

Magura release brings [breaking changes on API](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4903) logic of Nym. New APIs will only communicate with `nym-node` from this release and newer. Also old version of APIs won't be able to communicate with the new version of `nym-node`. We are also moving towards completely removing Nym Explorer API, which now has been only used to report nodes location.

Any new bonded node will provide only the bare minimum information: host, identity key and optionally custom port of its HTTP api - we highly recommend to set that one up to `8080`. Everything else will be discovered via the self-described API for maximum flexibility. This also includes the sphinx key, meaning if the API is not exposed, the node will be unable to route any traffic. Furthermore, this allows to arbitrary change of   `nym-node` from mixnode into a gateway modes (and vice versa) without losing any delegations.

The contract changes also mean any node functionality can get rewards. Rather than just with assigned mixing roles, gateways now also added into the pool. However, to be eligible for gateway rewarding, one must [migrate into a `nym-node`](#wallet-changes) on a smart contract level (or bond a new node).

##### API High Level Changes

###### New/Added

- All new routes that return multiple nodes/entries/etc now wrap their responses to expect pagination. Currently, however, full data is returned for each of the endpoints since the pagination hasn't been  implemented yet. But once we add it, it won't be a breaking API change.

###### Removed

- `rocket` support has been completely removed. All routes are now always served via `axum`

###### Changed

- Getting anything to do with all nodes (including gateways) requires knowing their `node_id`. For legacy gateway endpoints, we have a helper method that translates identity key to the `node_id`
- Rewarded set is no longer populated with just mixnodes. Instead `nym-node`s are assigned to eligible roles (based on stake and performance) in the following order:
    - entry gateways
    - exit gateways
    - mixnodes
    - standby
- A lot of legacy routes got deprecated. while technically they still "work" and return data, they only return data for legacy `nym-mixnode` and `nym-gateway`. What it means is that as operators are migrating their nodes (in the smart contract), those endpoints will start running dry.
- Since layers are only assigned during rewarded set assignment, for the purposes of network monitor (v1) and legacy mixnode routes, layerless nodes are put on random layers during annotation
- All legacy gateway queries now also include additional field in their respones: `node_id` that indicate the id pre-assigned during contract migration
- Nym Node performance is a bit odd. When network monitors (v1 and v2) were made, there was no concept of a Nym Node. The solution taken is checking whther there is any mixnode performance for node with a given id, if so - return it. Otherwise we grab the equivalent gateway performance. In the future it should probably be averaged or maybe split into explicit mixing or gateway routing performance metrics.

##### `nym-api` Changes

- Root route `/` now redirects to `/swagger`

###### `nym-node` Routes

<br />

<AccordionTemplate name="Nym Node API routes">
- `/v1/nym-nodes/annotation/<NODE_ID>` - get annotation about particular `nym-node`, as gathered by this `nym-api`. Currently this just includes last 24h performance metric and the current node role
- `/v1/nym-nodes/bonded` - get bond information about Nym Nodes, as present in the mixnet contract
- `/v1/nym-nodes/described` - get described information about Nym Nodes, as present on their self-described API

- `/v1/nym-nodes/performance-history/<NODE_ID>` - return performance history of this `nym-node` (as a 0 - 1 float)
- `/v1/nym-nodes/uptime-history/<NODE_ID>` - return current uptime of this `nym-node` (as a 0 - 100 u8); added for compatibility with existing APIs using that data format
- `/v1/nym-nodes/performance/<NODE_ID>` - return current performance of this `nym-node`
</ AccordionTemplate>

<br />

<AccordionTemplate name="Unstable API routes">
- `/v1/unstable/nym-nodes/noise` - returns basic information needed for the noise protocol between nodes
- `/v1/unstable/nym-nodes/skimmed/active` - returns all: Nym Nodes and legacy mixnodes and legacy gateways, that are currently in the active set, unless `no-legacy` parameter is used
- `/v1/unstable/nym-nodes/skimmed/mixnodes/active` - returns all: Nym Nodes and legacy mixnodes, that are currently in the active set, unless `no-legacy` parameter is used

- `/v1/unstable/nym-nodes/skimmed/exit-gateways/all` - returns all: Nym Nodes and legacy gateways, that are currently bonded and support exit gateway role, unless `no-legacy` parameter is used
</ AccordionTemplate>

###### Deprecated (will be removed eventually, so please migrate away from their usage)

Some endpoints got purposely deprecated without any equivalent reimplemented since they do not belong on `nym-api`. This includes for example `/stake-saturation` (which can be obtained directly from the contract instead) or `/inclusion-probability` (for this run your own Monte Carlo simulation).
<br />

    - `/v1/mixnodes`
    - `/v1/mixnodes/active` - just to restate the obvious, it will only return a small **SUBSET** of the active set that since it will ignore active Nym Nodes

- `Unstable Nym Nodes Routes`:
    - `/v1/unstable/nym-nodes/skimmed` - now works with `exit` parameter
    - `/v1/unstable/nym-nodes/skimmed` - introduced `no-legacy` flag to ignore legacy `nym-mixnode` and `nym-gateway` (where applicable)

</ AccordionTemplate>

##### Mixnet Contract

<Callout type="warning" emoji="">
**Every operator has to make sure that their nodes self-described endpoint works, otherwise the node will be un-routable and thus won't get any rewards!**
</Callout>

###### High Level Changes

**New/Added**

- All new nodes are now bonded as Nym Nodes, even when using old `BondMixnode` or `BondGateway` messages (messages are getting translated)
- Operators only announce nodes identity key (`<ID_KEY>`), host and port to the directory. Everything else is discovered via self-described endpoint
- All Nym Nodes in the rewarded set are eligible for rewards and staking. Even if they serve one of the gateway roles. Legacy gateways can't be staked on nor get rewards.
- All nodes, including legacy mixnodes and legacy gateways, are now uniquely identified by a monotonically increasing `node_id`
- All legacy gateways are preassigned `node_id` during the contract migration

**Removed**

> 🔥 all concepts of node families got purged, removed, deleted, thrown into the abyss. they simply no longer exist and the world is all better for it.

**Changed**

- Bunch of types got changed/renamed with some fields being added/removed/deprecated. It's be quite a lot of work to list them all here, but whenever possible and feasible, they should be cross-compatible (but not always).
- Rewarded set is no longer just a "number". Instead it has an explicit number of all `nym-node` modes: mixnodes, entry and exit gateways as well as standby nodes
- Rewarding is now based on two parameters: performance and work factor as opposed to performance and "is active" flag. However, in practice, during this transitional period, it is assumed that the work factor will be equivalent to what would have been calculated using the old "is active" flag

###### Transaction Messages Changes

<br />

<AccordionTemplate name="Added transaction messages">
- `BondNymNode` - self-explanatory
- `UnbondNymNode` - self-explanatory
- `UpdateNodeConfig` - works as `UpdateMixnodeConfig`; it lets you change your announced host or http api port
- `MigrateMixnode` - migrate your existing legacy mixnode into a Nym Node
- `MigrateGateway` - migrate your exsting legacy gasteway into a Nym Node. enables staking and rewarding
- `AssignRoles` - an additional step for epoch transition transactions. think of it as a replacement for `AdvanceCurrentEpoch`. it assigns nodes to particular roles for the given epoch
</AccordionTemplate>

<br />

<AccordionTemplate name="Removed transaction messages">
- As mentioned, all family-related things got killed off, so the following no longer exist: `CreateFamily`, `JoinFamily`, `LeaveFamily`, `KickFamilyMember`, `CreateFamilyOnBehalf`, `JoinFamilyOnBehalf`, `LeaveFamilyOnBehalf`, `KickFamilyMemberOnBehalf`
- `UpdateActiveSetSize` - the rewarded/active set are now based on the role distribution
- `AssignNodeLayer` - we're no longer explicitly assigning roles to all mixnodes, instead they get assigned mixing roles
- `AdvanceCurrentEpoch` - the logic for advancing the epoch/assigning active set has changed so this message was removed
</AccordionTemplate>

### Features

- [Rust sdk stream abstraction](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4743): Starting to move this from being standalone binaries (as seen [here](https://github.com/nymtech/nym-zcash-grpc-demo)) into the sdk. EDIT this has sort of expanded a bit to include a few things:
  - [x] simple example
  - [x] example doc to `src/tcp_proxy.rs`
  - [x] simple echo server in `tools/`
  - [x] multithread example
  - [x] example to sdk for using different network
  - [x] go ffi for proxies

- [Build(deps): bump `toml` from `0.5.11` to `0.8.14`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4805): [`toml`](https://github.com/toml-rs/toml) version update

<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Ensured that the `cargo.toml` is legible in various places; tested it on `nym-node`, `nym-api` and `nymvisor`.
- Ensured that updating the cargo.toml file and restarting the given binary continues to behave as normal.
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Use `serde` from workspace](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4833): cargo autoinherit for `serde` - cargo autoinherit for `bs58` and `vergen` in `cosmwasm-smart-contracts`

- [Gateway database modifications for different modes](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4868): As gateway clients will not be solely from the mixnet, we need to split the table that handles shared keys from the client ids that are referenced from other tables. That way, the bandwidth table can be shared between different client types (entry mixnet, entry gateway, exit gateway), using the same `client_id` referencing.

- [Remove the push trigger for `ci-nym-wallet-rust`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4869)

- [Chore: remove queued migration for adding explicit admin](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4871)

- [Allow clients to send stateless gateway requests without prior registration](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4873): in order to make changes to the registration/authentication procedure we needed a way of extracting protocol information before undergoing the handshake.

- [Fix sql `serde` with `enum`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4875)

- [Few fixes to NNM pre deploy](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4883)

- [Feature/updated gateway registration](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4885): This PR introduces support for aes256-gcm-siv shared keys between clients and gateways.
    - Those changes should be fully backwards compatible. if they're not, there's a bug.

<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- For the following combinations I inited the client, ran the client, stopped the client, and ran the client again:
- Fresh client on new binary && gateway on old binary
- Fresh client on old binary && gateway on new binary
- Fresh client on new binary && gateway new binary
- Existing old client on old binary & new gateway
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Build and Push CI](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4887)

- [Entry wireguard tickets](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4888): Note: The behaviour of the nodes and vpn client (as a test) has not changed, it still works as it used to. Obtaining ticketbooks also is unchanged

- [Update `nym-vpn` metapackage and replace `nymvpn-x` with `nym-vpn-app`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4889): Change dependency from `nymvpn-x` to `nym-vpn-app` to reflect the new package name of the tauri client

- [Update network monitor entry point](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4893)

- [Remove clippy github PR annotations](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4896): It eats up CI resources and time to run the clippy annotation checks that likely no one uses anyway. We keep the clippy checks of course.

- [Fix clippy for beta toolchain](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4897):

- [Update cargo deny](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4901): Update to use latest `cargo-deny`. Here are the steps done:
  - Regenerate `deny.toml`
  - Backport old settings to `deny.toml`
  - Explicitly allow GPL-3 only on our own specific crates
  - Update `deny.toml` for latest changes
  - Fix `cargo-deny` warnings for duplicate crates
  - Update `cargo-deny-action` to v2

- [Data Observatory stub](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4905): You need Postgres up for `sqlx` compile-time checked queries to work

<AccordionTemplate name={<TryYourself/>}>

- [Fix missing duplication of modified tables](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4904)

- [Fix nymvpn.com url in mainnet defaults](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4920): The old URL (nympvn.net) works since it is redirected to nymvpn.com, but the extra round-trip adds latency to all the API calls the vpn client does. So this PR should help speed things up, in particular when these API calls happen across the mixnet.

- [Fix handle drop](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4934)

- [Replace unreachable macro with an error return](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4958)

### Operators Guide, Tooling & Updates

#### Documentation Updates

- [Update FAQ sphinx size](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4946): This PR upgrades url to our code base sphinx creation from an outdated branch to develop.

#### Fast & Furious - WireGuard edition

Nym team started another round of load and speed testing. This time the tests are limited to Wireguard mode Gateways - to find out any weak spots for needed improvement. The load testing is happening directly on mainnet as it simulates a real user traffic which the network components must be able to handle in order.

Over past week we ran a total of three tests, with 450 clients at most. We've managed to push around 300 GB in total. Around 50% of requests failed. Over the course of those three tests, we did about 5000 requests, and bandwidth per client varies between 50Mb/s and 150Mb/s.

We already caught two bugs and [fixed](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4885) it in this release.

**The faster the operators upgrade to this [latest release](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/tag/nym-binaries-v2024.12-aero), the better**. A that will allow us to do more precise testing through the nodes without the registry bug, leading to more precise specs for `nym-node`.

Here are the aims of these tests:

1. Understanding of the wireguard network behavior under full load
    - How many client users can all entry gateways and exit gateways handle simultaneously?
    - How much sustained IP traffic can a subset of mainnet nodes sustain?
2. Needed improvements of Nym Node binaries to improve the throughput on mainnet
3. Measurement of required machine specs
    - Releasing a new spec requirements
4. Raw data record
5. Increase quality of Nym Nodes

Meanwhile we started to research pricing of stronger servers with unlimited bandwidth and higher (and stable) port speed, to arrive to a better understanding of needed rewards and grants to bootstrap the network before NymVPN launch.

More info about testing and tools for performance monitoring can be found in [this chapter](testing/performance.md).

> We would like to call out to operators to join the efforts and reach out to us if they know of solid ISPs who offer reliable dedicated services for good price or may even be interested in partnership.

#### Delegation Program

In October we again proceeded with our Delegation Program. 22 nodes didn't meet the program rules and got their delegation removed and 25 nodes from the que received delegation. Below is a complete list.

### Features

- [New Network Monitor](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4610): Monitors the Nym network by sending itself packages across the mixnet. Network monitor is running two tokio tasks, one manages mixnet clients and another manages monitoring itself. Monitor is designed to be driven externally, via an `HTTP api`. This means that it does not do any monitoring unless driven by something like [`locust`](https://locust.io/). This allows us to tailor the load externally, potentially distributing it across multiple monitors. Includes a dockerised setup for automatically spinning up monitor and driving it with locust.
    - *Note: NNM is not deployed on mainnet yet!*

- [Add get_mixnodes_described to validator_client](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4725)

- [Remove deprecated mark_as_success and use new disarm](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4751): Update function name to keep terminology consistent with tokio `CancellationToken DropGuard`.

- [Update peer refresh value](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4754): `lso` expose the value by moving it to wireguard types, and separate the refresh time to the database sync time, so that more probable and needed actions happen faster (refresh) and more improbable ones don't overload the system (peer suspended or stale)
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- **Noted** that the constants `DEFAULT_PEER_TIMEOUT` and `DEFAULT_PEER_TIMEOUT_CHECK` have been moved to `common/wireguard-types/src/lib.rs` and are now being used across modules for consistency
- **Observed** that the `peer_controller.rs` now separates the in-memory updates from the storage sync operations to reduce system load
- **Identified** that in-memory updates of peer bandwidth usage happen every `DEFAULT_PEER_TIMEOUT_CHECK` (every 5 seconds), while storage updates occur every 5 * `DEFAULT_PEER_TIMEOUT_CHECK` (every 25 seconds)

**Checked System Load and Performance:**

- **Monitored** system resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) during the test to assess the impact of the changes
- **Confirmed** that the separation of in-memory updates and storage syncs resulted in reduced system load, particularly I/O operations, compared to previous versions where storage updates occurred more frequently
- **Ensured** that the system remained responsive and no performance bottlenecks were introduced

- **Efficiency Improvement:** The separation of in-memory updates and storage syncs effectively reduced unnecessary database writes, improving system efficiency without compromising data accuracy
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Remove duplicate stat count for retransmissions](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4756)

- [Make gateway latency check generic](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4759): Replace concrete gateway type with trait in latency check, so we can make use of it in the vpn client.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Initialised new `nym-client` with the `--latency-based-selection` flag and ensured it still works as normal.
</AccordionTemplate>

- [chore: remove repetitive words](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4763)

- [Avoid race on ip and registration structures](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4766): To avoid a state where the ip is being cleared out before the registration is also cleared out, couple the two structures under the same lock, since they are anyway very inter-dependent.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
1.  - **Checked out** the release/2024.10-wedel branch containing the fix for the race condition on IP and registration structures
    - **Deployed** the on a controlled test environment to prevent interference

2. **Monitored Logs:**

    - **Enabled** debug logging to capture all events
    - **Monitored** logs in real-time to observe the handling of concurrent registration requests
    - **Checked** for any error messages, warnings, or indications of race conditions

3. **Verified Client Responses:**

    - Ensured that all clients received appropriate responses:
    - Successful registration with assigned IP and registration data
    - Appropriate error messages if no IPs were available or if other issues occurred
    - Confirmed that no clients were left in an inconsistent state (e.g., assigned an IP but not fully registered)

4. **Validated Normal Operation:**
    - **Conducted standard registration processes** with individual clients to confirm that regular functionality is unaffected via `nym-vpn-cli`
    - Ensured that authenticated clients could communicate over the network as expected
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Update dependabot](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4796): Bump max number of dependabot rust PRs to 10. Add readme entry to workspace package.

- [Run `cargo-autoinherit` for a few new crates](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4801): Run cargo-autoinherit for a few new crates - Sort crates list.

- [Add `axum` server to `nym-api`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4803): Summary PR to add axum functionality behind a feature flag `axum`, alongside rocket.

- [Remove unused wireguard flag from SDK](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4823)

- [Expose wireguard details on self described endpoint](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4825)

<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
Wireguard details are now visible at the nym-node endpoint `/api/v1/gateway/client-interfaces` as well as on the nym-api self-described endpoint `/api/v1/gateways/described`, above the existing data displaying mixnet_websocket information.

- [Create nym-repo-setup debian package and nym-vpn meta package](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4837): Create nym-repo-setup debian package that sets up the nymtech debian repo on the system it's installed on. It does 2 things:

    1. Copy the keyring to `/usr/share/keyrings/nymtech.gpg`
    2. Copy the repo spec to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/nymtech.list`
    - Also create a meta package `nym-vpn` which only purpose is to depend on the daemon and UI.

<AccordionTemplate name={<TryYourself/>}>
1. Install with
```sh
sudo dpkg -i ./nym-repo-setup.deb
```
2. Once it's installed, it should be possible to install the vpn client with
```sh
sudo apt install nym-vpnc
```
3. To remove the repo, use
```sh
sudo apt remove nym-repo-setup
```

NOTE: removing the repo will not remove any installed nym-vpn packages
</AccordionTemplate>


<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
1. **Downloaded** the `nym-repo-setup.deb` package to a Debian-based test system

2. **Installed** the repository setup package using the command:
```bash

- [Patch release binaries](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/tag/nym-binaries-v2024.10-caramello-patch)

```sh
Binary Name:        nym-node
Build Timestamp:    2024-09-16T15:00:41.019107021Z

Commit Branch:      HEAD
rustc Version:      1.81.0
rustc Channel:      stable
cargo Profile:      release
```

This patch fixes [`v202410-caramello`](#v202410-caramello) release [bug](#known-bugs--undone-features) where one of the used dependencies - [`DefGuard`](https://github.com/DefGuard/defguard/issues/619), was failing.

Updating to this patched version and running `nym-node --mode exit-gateway` with `--wireguard-enabled true` should result in a smooth node start without the `defguard_wireguard` error, occuring to some operators before:
```sh
/home/ubuntu/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/defguard_wireguard_rs-0.4.2/src/netlink.rs:155: Serialized netlink packet (23240 bytes) larger than maximum size 12288: NetlinkMessage.
```

This release is a patch only, there are no additional features, everything else stays the same like in the latest release [`v202410-caramello`](#v202410-caramello).

### Features

- [Add 1GB/day/user bandwidth cap](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4717)

<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
**Scenario 1: Bandwidth Decreasing Continuously**

1. Started the client and noted the initial bandwidth (e.g., 1GB).
2. Used the client and tracked bandwidth usage over time (e.g., decrease by 100MB every hour).
3. Restarted the client after some usage.
4. Verified the bandwidth continued from the last recorded value, not reset.

The bandwidth continued decreasing without resetting upon restart. Logs and reports correctly reflected the decreasing bandwidth.

**Scenario 2: Bandwidth Reset Next Day**

1. Used the client normally until the end of the day.
2. Suspended some clients and kept others active.
3. Checked bandwidth at midnight.
4. Verified that bandwidth reset to 1GB for both suspended and active clients.

Bandwidth reset to 1GB for all clients at midnight. Logs and reports correctly showed the reset.

**Scenario 3: Bandwidth Reset at a Different Time (e.g., Midday)**

1. Configured the system to reset bandwidth at midday.
2. Used the client and monitored bandwidth until midday.
3. Kept the client connected during the reset time.
4. Verified that bandwidth reset to 1GB live at midday.

Bandwidth reset to 1GB at midday while the client was connected. Logs and reports correctly reflected the reset.

**Scenario 4: Stale Check for 3 Days**

1. Kept a client inactive for 3 days.
2. Verified removal from the peer list after 3 days.
3. Reconnected the client after 3 days and checked for a new private IP.
4. Restarted a client within 3 days and verified it retained the same private IP.

The client was removed from the peer list after 3 days of inactivity. Upon re-connection after 3 days, the client received a new private IP. The client retained the same private IP when restarted within 3 days.
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Feature/merge back](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4710): Merge back from the release branch the changes that fix the `nym-node` upgrades

- [Removed mixnode/gateway config migration code and disabled cli without explicit flag](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4706): Commands for archived / legacy binaries `nym-gateway` and `nym-mixnode` won't do anything without explicit `--force-run` to bypass the deprecation. The next step, in say a month or so, is to completely remove all `cli` related things.

<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Verify that the `nym-gateway` binary and `nym-mixnode` binary commands return the _error message_ stating to update to nym-node
- Check that when adding the `--force-run` flag, it still allows the command to be run (aside from `init` which has been removed) and the message stating to update to nym-node is a _warning_ now
- Check `nym-node` is not affected
- Reviewed the changes in the PR
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Handle clients with different versions in IPR](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4723): Allow the IPR to handle clients connecting both using `v6` and `v7`, independently. The motivation is that we want to be able to roll out a API version change gradually for VPN clients without breaking backwards compatibility. The main feature on the new `v7` format that is not yet used, is that it adds signatures for connect/disconnect.

<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
Run the same command (using same gateways deployed from this PR) on different versions of the `nym-vpn-cli`.

Example:
```sh
sudo -E ./nym-vpn-cli -c ../qa.env run --entry-gateway-id $entry_gateway --exit-gateway-id $exit_gateway --enable-two-hop

sudo -E ./nym-vpn-cli -c ../qa.env run --entry-gateway-id $entry_gateway --exit-gateway-id $exit_gateway --enable-two-hop
```

    - Disables all non-essential operations on the vesting contract \=\> you can no longer bond mixnodes/make delegations/etc. (you can still, however, withdraw your vested tokens and so on)
    - Introduces admin-controlled minimum (and maximum) profit margin and interval operating costs.
    - both contracts have to be migrated **at the same time**. ideally within the same transaction
    - mixnet contract migration is not allowed (and will fail) if there are any pending actions involving vesting tokens, like delegating, increasing pledge, etc

### Operators Guide, Tooling & Updates

- More explicit [setup for `nym-node`](nodes/setup.md#initialise--run) with a new [option explanation](nodes/setup.md#essential-parameters--variables), including syntax examples

- New [VPS networking configuration steps for Wireguard](nodes/configuration.md#routing-configuration)

- Wireguard [builds from source](binaries/building-nym.md) together with `nym-node`, no need to specify with a feature flag anymore

- Wireguard peers stay connected for longer time, re-connections are also faster

- Profit margin and operating cost values are set to the values agreed by operators off-chain vote, the values can be changed in the future through [Nym Operators governance process](https://forum.nymtech.net/t/poll-proposal-for-on-chain-minimum-profit-margin-for-all-nym-nodes/253)

<Callout type="info" emoji="">
*Minimum profit margin = 20%* <br />
*Maximum profit margin = 50%* <br />
*Minimum operating cost = 0 NYM* <br />
*Maximum operating cost = 1000 NYM*
</Callout>

- [Nym Harbourmater](https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net) has several new functionalities:
    - Version counting graph for Gateways and Mixnodes
    - Several new columns with larger nodes performance and settings overview.
    - Top routing score now includes:
        - Wireguard registration and complete handshake test, to configure see [tasklist below](#operators-tasks)
        - DNS resolution check, to configure see [tasklist below](#operators-tasks)
        - Wireguard perfomance bigger than 0.75, to configure see [tasklist below](#operators-tasks)

- New [Nym Wallet](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/tag/nym-wallet-v1.2.14) is out!
    - Vesting contract functionalities have been purged, users can only remove tokens from vesting
    - Migrating from `mixnode` or `gateway` smart contracts to a new unifying `nym-node` smart contract will be available soon using Nym desktop wallet, just like you are used to for bonding and node settings. After this migration all `nym-nodes` will be able to receive delegation and rewards. We will share a step by step guide once this migration will be deployed. No action needed now.

- Nym API Check CLI is upgraded according to the latest API endpoints, output is cleaner and more concise.


#### Operators Tasks

<Callout type="warning" emoji="">
**The steps below are highly recommended for all operators and mandatory for everyone who is a part of Nym Delegation or Grant program. Deadline is Friday, September 20th, 2024.**
</Callout>

Every `nym-node` should be upgraded to the latest version! Operators can test using [Sandbox env](sandbox.mdx) during the pre-release period, then upgrade on mainnet. During the upgrade, please follow the points below before you restart the node:

**`nym-node`**

- Make sure to fill in basic description info, into the file located at `.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/data/description.toml` (all nodes)
- Configure wireguard routing with new [`network_tunnel_manager.sh`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/scripts/network_tunnel_manager.sh) following [these steps](nodes/configuration.md#routing-configuration) (Gateways only for the time being)
- Enable Wireguard with `--wireguard-enabled true` flag included in your run command (Gateways only for the time being)
    - Note: On some VPS this setup may not be enough to get the correct results as some ISPs  have their own security groups setup below the individual VPS. In that case a ticket to ISP will have to be issued to open the needed settings. We are working on a template for such ticket.
- Setup [reverse proxy and WSS](nodes/proxy-configuration.md) on `nym-node` (Gateways only for the time being)
- Don't forget to restart your node - or (preferably using [systemd automation](nodes/nym-node/configuration.mdx#systemd)) reload daemon and restart the service
- Optional: Use [`nym-gateway-probe`](testing/gateway-probe.html) and [NymVPN CLI](https://nymtech.net/developers/nymvpn/cli.html) to test your own Gateway
- Optional: Run the script below to measure ping speed of your Gateway and share your results in [Nym Operators channel](https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat)

<AccordionTemplate name='The script to measure Gateway ping results'>
We made a script for pinging nymtech.net from your GWs. Can you please install it and then share the result together with your Gateway ID:

1. Get the script onto your machine (soon on github for curl or wget):

```sh
# paste all this block as one command
cat <<'EOL' > ping_with_curl_average_for_wg_check.sh
#!/bin/bash

ping_with_curl_average_for_wg_check() {
    total_connect_time=0
    total_total_time=0
    iterations=5
    timeout=2

    for ((i=1; i<=iterations; i++)); do
        echo "ping attempt $i..."

        echo "curling nymtech.net to check ping response times"
        times=$(curl -I https://nymtech.net --max-time $timeout \
        -w "time_connect=%{time_connect}\ntime_total=%{time_total}" -o /dev/null -s)

        time_connect=$(echo "$times" | grep "time_connect" | cut -d"=" -f2)
        time_total=$(echo "$times" | grep "time_total" | cut -d"=" -f2)

        total_connect_time=$(echo "$total_connect_time + $time_connect" | bc)
        total_total_time=$(echo "$total_total_time + $time_total" | bc)

        echo "time to connect: $time_connect s"
        echo "total time: $time_total s"
    done

    average_connect_time=$(echo "scale=3; $total_connect_time / $iterations" | bc)
    average_total_time=$(echo "scale=3; $total_total_time / $iterations" | bc)

    echo "-----------------------------------"
    echo "average time to connect: $average_connect_time s"
    echo "average total time: $average_total_time s"
}

ping_with_curl_average_for_wg_check
EOL
```

2. Make executable:

```sh
chmod +x ping_with_curl_average_for_wg_check.sh
```

3. In case you don't have `bc`, install it:

```sh
sudo apt install bc
```

4. Run:

```sh
./ping_with_curl_average_for_wg_check.sh
```

5. Share results and ID key in [Nym Operators channel](https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat)

THANK YOU!

**validators**

- Validators need to update and prepare for ecash implementation.

### Known Bugs & Undone features

- New `nym-nodes` without a performance 24h history above 50% don't show routing properly on `nym-gateway-probe`, on Nym Harbourmaster the page may appear blank - we are working on a fix.
- Wireguard works on IPv4 only for the time being, we are working on IPv6 implementation.
- Harbourmaster *Role* column shows `nym-node --mode exit-gateway` as `EntryGateway`, we are working to fix it.
- In rare occassions Harbourmaster shows only *"panda"* without the *"smiley"* badge even for nodes, which have T&C's accepted. We are working to fix it.
- Sometimes `nym-node` running with `--wireguard-enabled true` gives this error on restart: `Serialized netlink packet .. larger than maximum size ..`
```sh
/home/ubuntu/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/defguard_wireguard_rs-0.4.2/src/netlink.rs:155: Serialized netlink packet (23240 bytes) larger than maximum size 12288: NetlinkMessage.
```

From what we found out it seems that one of our [dependencies - `DefGuard` - is failing](https://github.com/DefGuard/defguard/issues/619). Based on the reading on their fix, it seems that when node operators try to re-create a wireguard interface with too many previous peers (like on Gateway restart, with restoring from storage), there's an overflow. So their fix is to just add them one by one. To be sure that bumping the dependency version fixes the problem there's still two things we'd need to check - and your feedback would help us a lot:

1. Did operators only encounter this error after a `nym-node` (Gateway) restart?
2. Reprouce this error ourselves and see if it actually fixes our problem.

**Please share your experience with us to help faster fix of this issue.**

[#4717]: https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4717
[#4710]: https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4710
[#4706]: https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4706
</AccordionTemplate>

### Features

* [Removed `nym-mixnode` and `nym-gateway` config migration code and disabled CLI without explicit flag](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4706): Gateway and Mixnode commands now won't do anything without explicit `--force-run` to bypass the deprecation, instead it will tell an operator to run a `nym-node`.  The next step, in say a month or so, is to completely remove all `cli` related things.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Verify that the `nym-gateway` binary and `nym-mixnode` binary commands return the `_error message_` stating to *update to `nym-node`*
- Check that when adding the `--force-run` flag, it still allows the command to be run (aside from `init` which has been removed) and the message stating to update to `nym-node` is a `_warning_` now
- Check `nym-node` is not affected
- Review the changes in the PR
</AccordionTemplate>

* [Add 1GB/day/user bandwidth cap](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4717)

<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
**Scenario 1: Bandwidth Decreasing Continuously'**

1. Start the client and noted the initial bandwidth (e.g., 1GB).
2. Us the client and track bandwidth usage over time (e.g., decrease by 100MB every hour).
3. Restart the client after some usage.
4. Verify the bandwidth continued from the last recorded value, not reset.

**Notes:**
 The bandwidth continued decreasing without resetting upon restart. Logs and reports correctly reflected the decreasing bandwidth.


**Scenario 2: Bandwidth Reset Next Day'**

1. Use the client normally until the end of the day.
2. Suspend some clients and kept others active.
3. Check bandwidth at midnight.
4. Verify that bandwidth reset to 1GB for both suspended and active clients.

**Notes:**
Bandwidth reset to 1GB for all clients at midnight. Logs and reports correctly showed the reset.

**Scenario 3: Bandwidth Reset at a Different Time (e.g., Midday)'**

1. Configure the system to reset bandwidth at midday.
2. Use the client and monitored bandwidth until midday.
3. Keep the client connected during the reset time.
4. Verify that bandwidth reset to 1GB live at midday.

**Notes:**
Bandwidth reset to 1GB at midday while the client was connected. Logs and reports correctly reflected the reset.
</AccordionTemplate>

* [Handle clients with different versions in IPR](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4723): Allow the IPR to handle clients connecting both using `v6` and `v7`, independently. The motivation is that we want to be able to roll out an API version change gradually for NymVPN clients without breaking backwards compatibility. The main feature on the new `v7` format that is not yet used, is that it adds signatures for connect/disconnect.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
Run the same command (using same gateways deployed from this PR) on different versions of the `nym-vpn-cli`.

Example:
```sh
sudo -E ./nym-vpn-cli -c ../qa.env run --entry-gateway-id $entry_gateway --exit-gateway-id $exit_gateway --enable-two-hop

sudo -E ./nym-vpn-cli -c ../qa.env run --entry-gateway-id $entry_gateway --exit-gateway-id $exit_gateway --enable-two-hop
```
</AccordionTemplate>

### Bugfix

* [Feature/merge back](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4710): Merge back from the release branch the changes that fix the `nym-node` upgrades.

* [Fix version `1.x.x` not having template correspondent initially](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4733): This should fix the problem of config deserialisation when operators upgrade nodes and skip over multiple versions.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Tested updating an old nym-node version and ensuring it did not throw any errors.
</AccordionTemplate>

* [chore: fix 1.80 lint issues](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4731):
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Building all binaries is ok
- Running `cargo fmt` returns no issues
</AccordionTemplate>

### Operators Guide updates

* [WireGuard tunnel configuration guide](nodes/configuration.md#routing-configuration) for `nym-node` (currently Gateways functionalities). For simplicity we made a detailed step by step guide to upgrade an existing `nym-node` to the latest version and configure your VPS routing for WireGuard. Open by clicking on the example block below.

<AccordionTemplate name="Upgrading with wireguard">
**Prerequisites**

- **Nym Node Version:** You must be running the `2024.9-topdeck` release branch, which operates as `nym-node` version `1.1.6`. You can find the release here: [Nym 2024.9-topdeck Release](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/tag/nym-binaries-v2024.9-topdeck).

- **Important:** Before proceeding, make sure to [back up](nodes/maintenance.md#backup-a-node) your current `nym-node` configuration to avoid any potential data loss or issues.


- **Download Nym Node:**
- You can download the `nym-node` binary directly using the following command:
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/download/nym-binaries-v2024.9-topdeck/nym-node -o nym-node && chmod u+x nym-node
```

**Step 1: Update UFW Firewall Rules**

- **Warning:** Enabling the firewall with UFW without allowing SSH port 22 first will lead to losing access over SSH. Make sure port 22 is allowed before proceeding with any UFW configurations.

Run the following as root or with `sudo` prefix:

1. Check the current status of UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):
```bash
ufw status
```

2. Ensure that the following ports are allowed on your machine before adding the WireGuard port:

```bash
ufw allow 22/tcp    # SSH - you're in control of these ports
ufw allow 80/tcp    # HTTP
ufw allow 443/tcp   # HTTPS
ufw allow 1789/tcp  # Nym specific
ufw allow 1790/tcp  # Nym specific
ufw allow 8080/tcp  # Nym specific - nym-node-api
ufw allow 9000/tcp  # Nym Specific - clients port
ufw allow 9001/tcp  # Nym specific - wss port
ufw allow 51822/udp # WireGuard
```

3. Confirm that the UFW rules have been updated:
```bash
ufw status
```

**Step 2: Download and Prepare the Network Tunnel Manager Script**

1. Download the [`network_tunnel_manager.sh`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/scripts/network_tunnel_manager.sh) script:
```bash
curl -L -o network_tunnel_manager.sh https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/scripts/network_tunnel_manager.sh
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod u+x network_tunnel_manager.sh
```

3. Apply the WireGuard IPTables rules:
```bash
./network_tunnel_manager.sh apply_iptables_rules_wg
```

**Step 3: Update the Nym Node Service File**

1. Modify your [`nym-node` service file](nodes/configuration.md#systemd) to enable WireGuard. Open the file (usually located at `/etc/systemd/system/nym-node.service`) and update the `[Service]` section as follows:

```ini
[Service]
User=<YOUR_USER_NAME>
Type=simple
#Environment=RUST_LOG=debug
# CAHNGE PATH IF YOU DON'T RUN IT FROM ROOT HOME DIRECTORY
ExecStart=/root/nym-node run --mode exit-gateway --id <YOUR_NODE_LOCAL_ID> --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions --wireguard-enabled true
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30
StartLimitInterval=350
StartLimitBurst=10
LimitNOFILE=65536

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

# ADD OR TWEAK ANY CUSTOM SETTINGS
```

2. Reload the systemd daemon to apply the changes:
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```

3. Restart the `nym-node service`:
```bash
systemctl restart nym-node.service
```

4. Optionally, you can check if the node is running correctly by monitoring the service logs:
```bash
journalctl -u nym-node.service -f -n 100
```

**Step 4: Run the Network Tunnel Manager Script**

Finally, run the following command to initiate our favorite routing test - run the joke through the WireGuard tunnel:
```bash
./network_tunnel_manager.sh joke_through_wg_tunnel
```

- **Note:** Wireguard will return only IPv4 joke, not IPv6. WG IPv6 is under development. Running IPR joke through the mixnet with `./network_tunnel_manager.sh joke_through_the_mixnet` should work with both IPv4 and IPv6!
</AccordionTemplate>

* [Change `--wireguard-enabled` flag to `true`](nodes/setup.md#-initialise--run): With a proper [routing configuration](nodes/configuration.md#routing-configuration) `nym-nodes` running as Gateways can now enable WG. See the example below:

<AccordionTemplate name="Run node with wireguard enabled">
For Exit Gateway:
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --mode exit-gateway --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)" --hostname <HOSTNAME> --http-bind-address 0.0.0.0:8080 --mixnet-bind-address 0.0.0.0:1789 --location <LOCATION> --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions --wireguard-enabled true

# wireguard can be enabled from version 1.1.6 onwards
```

For Entry Gateway:
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --mode entry-gateway --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)" --hostname <HOSTNAME> --http-bind-address 0.0.0.0:8080 --mixnet-bind-address 0.0.0.0:1789 --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions --wireguard-enabled true

# wireguard can be enabled from version 1.1.6 onwards
```
</AccordionTemplate>

* [Update Nym exit policy](https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/exit-policy.txt): Based on the survey, AMA and following discussions we added several ports to Nym exit policy. The ports voted upon in the [forum governance](https://forum.nymtech.net/t/poll-a-new-nym-exit-policy-for-exit-gateways-and-the-nym-mixnet-is-inbound/464) have not been added yet due to the concerns raised. These ports were unrestricted:

* [Add `authenticator`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4667)

### Bugfix

* [`Node_api_check.py` CLI looked over roles on blacklisted nodes](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4687): Removing/correcting this redundant function which results in unwanted error print, will resolve in the program not looking up the `roles` endpoint for blacklisted GWs, instead just ignores the role description and still return all other endpoints.

### Features

- [Make embedded NR/IPR ignore performance of the Gateway](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4671): fixes bug in relation to scoring issue on nym-nodes operating as exit gateways failing to come online.
- [Introduce a flag to accept Operators Terms and Conditions and exposed it via self-described API](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4647)
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Verify that the `execute` function correctly checks if the `accept_operator_terms` flag is set.
- Test that a warning is displayed when the `accept_operator_terms` flag is not set.
- Confirm that the `NymNode` instance is initialized with `with_accepted_toc(accepted_toc)` when the flag is set.
- Apply the `--accept-toc` flag in the service and confirmed the change by running:
```sh
curl -s -X 'GET' 'http://18.171.251.41:8080/api/v1/auxiliary-details?output=json' -H 'accept: application/json' | jq .accepted_toc
```
- Verify that the output is `true`.
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Rename 'accept-toc' flag and fields into explicit 'accept-operator-terms-and-conditions'](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4654): makes the `accept-toc` flag more explicit.
- [Validate nym-node public ips on startup](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4630): makes sure `nym-node` is not run with an empty `public_ips` and that they do not correspond to common misconfigurations like `127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0` unless run with `--local` flag.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Use the latest release/chomp binary with nym-node and input a dodgy ip

When restarting the node it complains within the service launch file
</AccordionTemplate>

- [New node endpoints](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4635): introduces new endpoints on nym-api (and creates scaffolding for additional ones) for providing **unfiltered** network topology alongside performance score of all nodes.
    - `NymApiTopologyProvider` got modified to use those endpoints alongside (configurable) filtering of nodes with score \< 50% (like our current blacklist)
    - Old clients should work as before as no existing endpoint got removed
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Validate that the `skimmed` endpoints are working, keeping in mind that they are unstable. The *full-fat* and *semi-skimmed* have not yet been implemented.
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Remove stale peers](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4640)
- [Removed ephemera code](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4642)
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Check references to everything named SP and Ephemera and removed any additional references
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Remove additional code as part of Ephemera Purge and SP and contracts](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4650): in line with [#4642](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4642) and [#4603](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4603)
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Check references to everything named SP and Ephemera and removed any additional references
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Add ci check for PR having an assigned milestone](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4644): add a CI check for checking that a PR is assigned to a milestone. Can bypassed the check by adding a `no-milestone` label to a PR
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- CI complains if no milestone is associated with the an issue.
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Bump defguard wireguard](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4625)
- [Add generic wireguard private network routing](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4636): as defguard wireguard only allows for peer routing modifications, we will configure the entire wireguard private network to be routed to the wg device. Configuring per peer is also not desirable, as the interface doesn't allow removing routes, so unused ip routing won't be cleaned until gateway restart (and it would also pollute to routing table with a lot of rules when many peers are added).
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- This is a part of a bigger ticket, but initial testing has proven to shown that launching nym-nodes (entry and exit gateways) in WG enable mode to be working

*QA will use this template for the other related WG tickets in this release milestone.*
</AccordionTemplate>
- [Standarise `ContractBuildInformation` and add it to all contracts](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4631): Similarly to `cw2`, we're now saving `ContractBuildInformation` under a constant storage key, i.e. `b"contract_build_info"` that standarises the retrieval by nym-api.
    - Also each of our contracts now saves and updates that information upon init and migration.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Use the latest release/chomp contracts and deploy these to QA
- Use the `nym-api` to query for the results of these new contracts

```sh
 curl -X 'GET' \
   'https://qa-nym-api.qa.nymte.ch/api/v1/network/nym-contracts-detailed' \
   -H 'accept: application/json'
```

- It returns a detailed view of the contracts and which branch they were built from, alongside rust versions and so forth.

</AccordionTemplate>

- [Update kernel peers on peer modification](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4622):
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- This is a part of a bigger ticket, but initial testing has proven to shown that launching nym-nodes (entry and exit gateways) in WG enable mode to be working.
*QA will use this template for the other related WG tickets in this release milestone.*
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Handle v6 and v7 requests in the IPR, but reply with v6](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4620): teach the IPR to read both v6 and v7 requests, but always reply with v6. This is to prepare for bumping to v7 and signed connect/disconnect messages. Follow up PRs will add
    - Verify signature
    - Send v7 in client with signatures included
- [Purge name service and service provider directory contracts](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4603): this is a compiler assisted purge of the `nym-name-service` and `nym-service-provider-directory` contracts that were never deployed on mainnet, and will anyhow be superseded by the new mixnode directory that is being worked on.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
It works insofar that it compiles, we need to deploy and test this on non-mainnet before merging in

- Purge `nym-name-service` contract
- Purge `nym-name-service-common`
- Purge `nym-service-provider-directory` contract
- Purge `nym-service-provider-directory-common`
- Remove everywhere name-service contract is used
- Remove everywhere sp contract is used

Performed:
- Check references to everything named SP and Ephemera and removed any additional references
</AccordionTemplate>

### Crypto

- [Update crypto and rand crates](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4607): Update sphinx crate to `0.1.1` along with 25519 crates and `rand` crates
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
This PR contains a test failure due to the update [here](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/b4a0487a41375167b2f481c00917b957b9f89789/common/crypto/src/asymmetric/encryption/mod.rs#L353-L358)

- This is due a change in `x25519-dalek` from `1.1.1` to `2`.
- Crypto operations should be identical, but the byte representation has changed (sphinx clamps at creation, x25519 clamps at use). This cannot be changed in the sphinx crate without breaking changes.
- There is a good chance that this failure doesn't impact anything else, but it has to be tested to see.
- A mix of old and new clients with a mix of old and new mixnodes should do
</AccordionTemplate>

### Bugfix
- [Make sure nym-api can handle non-cw2 (or without detailed build info) compliant contracts](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4648): fixes the issue (even if some contracts aren't uploaded on chain it doesn't prohibit the api from working - caveat, the essential vesting and mixnet contract are required)
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Use the latest release/chomp contracts and deploy these to QA
- If the contract was not found, the API would complain of invalid contracts, thus not starting the rest of the operations of the API (network monitor / rewarding etc)

 `Jun 11 16:27:34 qa-v2-nym-api bash[1352642]:  2024-06-11T16:27:34.551Z ERROR nym_api::nym_contract_cache::cache::refresher - Failed to refresh validator cache - Abci query failed with code 6 - address n14y2x8a60knc5jjfeztt84kw8x8l5pwdgnqg256v0p9v4p7t2q6eswxyusw: no such contract: unknown request`

</AccordionTemplate>

- [Extend the return error when connecting to gateway fails](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4626)
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Verify that the `establish_connection` function correctly attempts to establish a connection to the gateway.
- Test error handling for `NetworkConnectionFailed` by simulating a failed connection.
- Ensure that the `NetworkConnectionFailed` error includes the `address` and `source` details as expected.
- Checked that `SocketState::Available` is set correctly when a connection is successfully established.
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Fix Cargo warnings](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4624): On every cargo command we have the set warnings:
<AccordionTemplate name="Cargo warnings">
warning: /home/alice/src/nym/nym/common/dkg/Cargo.toml: `default-features` is ignored for bls12_381, since `default-features` was not specified for `workspace.dependencies.bls12_381`, this could become a hard error in the future warning: /home/alice/src/nym/nym/common/dkg/Cargo.toml: `default-features` is ignored for ff, since `default-features` was not specified for `workspace.dependencies.ff`, this could become a hard error in the future warning: /home/alice/src/nym/nym/common/dkg/Cargo.toml: `default-features` is ignored for group, since `default-features` was not specified for `workspace.dependencies.group`, this could become a hard error in the future warning: /home/alice/src/nym/nym/common/client-libs/validator-client/Cargo.toml: `default-features` is ignored for bip32, since `default-features` was not specified for `workspace.dependencies.bip32`, this could become a hard error in the future warning: /home/alice/src/nym/nym/common/client-libs/validator-client/Cargo.toml: `default-features` is ignored for prost, since `default-features` was not specified for `workspace.dependencies.prost`, this could become a hard error in the future warning: /home/alice/src/nym/nym/common/credentials-interface/Cargo.toml: `default-features` is ignored for bls12_381, since `default-features` was not specified for `workspace.dependencies.bls12_381`, this could become a hard error in the future warning: /home/alice/src/nym/nym/common/credentials/Cargo.toml: `default-features` is ignored for bls12_381, since `default-features` was not specified for `workspace.dependencies.bls12_381`, this could become a hard error in the future warning: /home/alice/src/nym/nym/common/nymcoconut/Cargo.toml: `default-features` is ignored for bls12_381, since `default-features` was not specified for `workspace.dependencies.bls12_381`, this could become a hard error in the future warning: /home/alice/src/nym/nym/common/nymcoconut/Cargo.toml: `default-features` is ignored for ff, since `default-features` was not specified for `workspace.dependencies.ff`, this could become a hard error in the future warning: /home/alice/src/nym/nym/common/nymcoconut/Cargo.toml: `default-features` is ignored for group, since `default-features` was not specified for `workspace.dependencies.group`, this could become a hard error in the future.
</AccordionTemplate>
    - This PR adds `default-features = false` to the workspace dependencies to fix these. An alternative way would be to remove `default-features = false` in the crates, but we assume these were put there for a good reason. Also we might have other crates outside of the main workspace that depends on these crates having default features disabled.
    - We also have the warning `warning: profile package spec nym-wasm-sdk in profile release did not match any packages`  which we fix by commenting out the profile settings, since the crate is currently commented out in the workspace crate list.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- All binaries have been built and deployed from this branch and no issues have surfaced.

### Features

- New `nym-node` API endpoint `/api/v1/auxiliary-details`: to expose any additional information. Currently it's just the location. `nym-api` will then query all nodes for that information and put it in the `self-described` endpoint.
- New `nym-node` location available - use one of the three options to add this to your node config:
    1. Update the `location` field under `[host]` section of `config.toml`
    2. For new nodes: Initialise the node with `--location` flag, where they have to provide the country info. Either full country name (e.g. 'Jamaica'), two-letter alpha2 (e.g. 'JM'), three-letter alpha3 (e.g. 'JAM') or three-digit numeric-3 (e.g. '388') can be provided.
    3. For existing nodes: It's also possible to use exactly the same `--location` argument as above, but make sure to also provide `--write-changes` (or `-w`) flag to persist those changes!
- [Feature/unstable tested nodes endpoint](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4601): Adds new data structures (`TestNode`, `TestRoute`, `PartialTestResult`) to handle test results for Mixnodes and Gateways. With the inclusion of pagination to handle large API responses efficiently. Lastly, introducing a new route with the tag `unstable` thus meaning not to be consumed without a user risk, prefixes in endpoints with unstable, are what it says on the tin.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Deploy new api changes to sandbox environment
- Ensure current operations are transactional and standed operations are working
- Run a script to ensure that the new endpoints are working as expected with pagination

- [`nym-api`: make report/avg_uptime endpoints ignore blacklist](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4599): When querying for node specific data, it's no longer going to go through the entire list of all cached (and filtered nodes) to find it; instead it will attempt to retrieve a single unfiltered entry.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Build the project and deployed it in a test environment.
- Manually test API endpoints for mixnode and gateway data.
- Verify that the endpoints return the expected data and handle blacklists correctly.
- API performance improved due to the efficient `HashMap` lookups
- Data in mainnet will differ from test nets due to the increased amount of gateways and mixnodes in that environment
- Test standard uptime routes:
```sh
curl -X 'GET' 'https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/status/gateway/Fo4f4SQLdoyoGkFae5TpVhRVoXCF8UiypLVGtGjujVPf/avg_uptime' -H 'accept: application/json'
```
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Use rfc3339 for last_polled in described nym-api endpoint](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4591): Fix issue where the validator-client can't parse the nym-api response for the described endpoint, in particular the `latest_polled` field that was recently added, by making the field use `rfc3339`
    - **Note:** This will require upgrading `nym-api` and everything that depends on the described endpoint.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Update a `nym-api` to the binary built from this branch, then restart the api
- Check the `journalctl` for error messages
- Connected via client and could not see the error messages, this is backwards compatible
- Local testing using sdk examples:
```sh
cd <PATH_TO>/nym/sdk/rust/nym-sdk
cargo run --example simple

# outcome

- [Upgrade `axum` and related dependencies to the most recent version](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4573)
- [Run cargo autoinherit on the main workspace](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4553): Move several dependencies to the workspace level using cargo autoinherit, to make it easier to keep our dependencies up to date.
    - Run cargo autoinherit in the root
    - Merge in the new workspace deps in the main list
    - We made sure to not mix in other changes as well - all features flags for all crates should be the same as before
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Run `cargo autoinherit` in the root directory to move dependencies to the workspace level
- Merge the new workspace dependencies into the main list
- Ensure no other changes were mixed in during the process
- Verify that all feature flags for all crates remained the same as before
- Build all the binaries from this branch to confirm successful compilation
- Deploy the built binaries across different environments to ensure there were no issues
</AccordionTemplate>

- [Add rustls-tls to reqwest in validator-client](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4552): An attempt to make possible to end up in a situation where use use the validator-client but without functioning TLS support. For the monorepo this is masked by cargo feature unification, but becomes a problem for outside consumers, as as been noticed in many of the vpn client implementations.
    - In `validator-client`: `reqwest`, enable `rustls-tls` for `non-wasm32`
    - In `client-core`: Use default features enabled for `non-wasm32` and switch to `webpki` roots, since that's what we're using with `reqwest` anyway
    - In `gateway-client`: Switch to `webpki` roots, since that's what we're using with `reqwest` anyway

#### Crypto

- [Remove blocking for coconut in the final epoch state](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4598)
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Build the project to ensure no compilation errors
- Run tests to verify the functionality of the `issue_credential` function
- Execute integration tests to check the behaviour during an epoch transition.

- [Allow using explicit admin address for issuing freepasses](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4595)
- [Explicitly handle constraint unique violation when importing credential](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4588): Add a strong type for when a duplicate credential is imported so the vpn lib can handle this.
- [Feature/wasm coconut](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4584): This pull request requires [\#4585](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4585) to be merged first
- [Feature/nyxd scraper pruning](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4564): This PR introduces storage pruning to `nyxd` scraper which is then used by the validators rewarder.
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Add a `main.rs` file in the `nyxd` scraper dir, underneath `lib.rs`, amend `config.pruning_options.validate()?;` to be `let _ = config.pruning_options.validate();` in the mod.rs file
- Test the different variations of `pruning_options`:
    - Check the *default* option: `pruning_options: PruningOptions::default()`
    - Check the *nothing* option: `pruning_options: PruningOptions::nothing()`
    - Check the *custom* option, example: `pruning_options: PruningOptions { keep_recent: (500), interval: (10), strategy: (PruningStrategy::Custom) }`
    - Check the pruning *in real life* for the validator rewarder
- Validate that the database table `blocks` was being updated accordingly
</AccordionTemplate>

    - The `--no_banner` flag works as intended, providing compatibility with `nymvisor`
<AccordionTemplate name={<TestingSteps/>}>
- Build the project to ensure no compilation errors
- Run the binary with different command-line arguments to verify the CLI functionality
- Test with and without the `--no_banner` flag to ensure compatibility and expected behavior
- Verify logging setup and configuration file parsing
