# Nym Node Setup & Run

This documentation page provides a guide on how to set up and run a [NYM NODE](nym-node.md), along with explanations of available flags, commands, and examples.

## Current version

```
<!-- cmdrun ../../../../target/release/nym-node --version -->
```

```admonish info
**Migrating an existing node to a new `nym-node` is simple. The steps are documented [below](#migrate).**
```

```admonish note
If you are a `nym-mixnode` or `nym-gateway` operator and you are not familiar with the binary changes called *Project Smoosh*, you can read the archived [Smoosh FAQ](../archive/faq/smoosh-faq.md) page.
```

## Summary

> Any syntax in `<>` brackets is a user's unique variable. Exchange with a corresponding name without the `<>` brackets.

To run a new node, you can simply execute the `nym-node` command without any flags. By default, the node will set necessary configurations. If you later decide to change a setting, you can use the `-w` flag.

The most crucial aspect of running the node is specifying the `--mode`, which can be one of three: `mixnode`, `entry-gateway`, and `exit-gateway`.

Currently the `nym-node` binary can only be run in a single `--mode` at any one time. In the future however, operators will be able to specify multiple modes that a single `nym-node` binary can run. Our goal is to have as many nodes as possible enabling multiple modes, and allow the Nym API to position the node according the network's needs in the beginning of each epoch.

Every `exit-gateway` mode is basically an `entry-gateway` with NR (Network Requester) and IPR (IP Packet Router) enabled. This means that every `exit-gateway` is automatically seen as an `entry-gateway` but not the opposite.

Gateway operators can check out the node performance, connectivity and much more in our new tool [harbourmaster.nymtech.net](https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/).

To determine which mode your node is running, you can check the `:8080/api/v1/roles` endpoint. For example:
```sh
# sustitude <NODE_IP_ADDRESS> or <NODE_DOMAIN> with a real one
# for http
http://<NODE_IP_ADDRESS>:8080/api/v1/roles
# or
http://<NODE_IP_ADDRESS>/api/v1/roles

# for reversed proxy/WSS
https://<NODE_DOMAIN>/api/v1/roles
```

Everything necessary will exist on your node by default. For instance, if you're running a mixnode, you'll find that a NR (Network Requester) and IPR (IP Packet Router) address exist, but they will be ignored in `mixnode` mode.

For more information about available endpoints and their status, you can refer to:
```sh
# sustitude <NODE_IP_ADDRESS> or <NODE_DOMAIN> with a real one
# for http
http://<NODE_IP_ADDRESS>:8080/api/v1/swagger/#/
# or
http://<NODE_IP_ADDRESS>/api/v1/swagger/#/

# for reversed proxy/WSS
https://<NODE_DOMAIN>/api/v1/swagger/#/
```

## Usage

### Help Command

There are a few changes from the individual binaries used in the past. For example by default `run` command does `init` function as well, local node `--id` will be set by default unless specified otherwise etcetera.

```admonish info
You can always use `--help` flag to see the commands or arguments associated with a given command.
```

Run `./nym-node --help` to see all available commands:

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="`./nym-node --help` output:"
```
<!-- cmdrun ../../../../target/release/nym-node --help -->
```
~~~

To list all available flags for each command, run `./nym-node <COMMAND> --help` for example `./nym-node run --help`:

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="`./nym-node run --help` output:"
```
<!-- cmdrun ../../../../target/release/nym-node run --help  -->
```
~~~

```admonish warning
The Wireguard flags currently have limited functionality. From version `1.1.6` ([`v2024.9-topdeck`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/tag/nym-binaries-v2024.9-topdeck)) wireguard is available and recommended to be switched on for nodes running as Gateways. Keep in mind that this option needs a bit of a special [configuration](configuration.md#wireguard-setup).
```

#### Flags Summary

Some of the most useful flags and their explanation:

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="Flags explanation:"
- `--id <YOUR_ID>`: Local identifier of your node. This `<ID>` determines your config path located at `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/config/config.toml`, default value is `default-nym-node`
- `--accept-operator-terms-and-conditions`:  Explicitly specify whether you agree with the terms and conditions of a nym node operator as defined at [nymtech.net/terms-and-conditions/operators/v1.0.0]({{toc_page}})
- `--config-file <PATH>`: Used for the migrate command to indicate the location of the existing node config file. Default path is `~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/config/config.toml`
- `--deny-init`: Use this flag to prevent a new node from being initialized. It's recommended to use this after the first run to avoid accidental spinning up of a second node.
- `--init-only`: Use this flag if you want to set up a node without starting it.
- `--mode`: Determines the mode of the node and is always required.
- `--write-changes`: Used to change values within the `config.toml` file after the node has been run.
- `--mnemonic`: This is for when gateways are coconut-credentials-enforced, and this mnemonic is used as the `double_spend` prevention. This account needs credit in order for it to work.
- `--expose-system-info <true/false>`: Sets your system info visibility on the network.
- `--expose-system-hardware <true/false>`: Sets your system hardware info visibility on the network.
- `--expose-crypto-hardware <true/false>`: Sets your crypto hardware info visibility on the network.
~~~

### Terms & Conditions

```admonish info
From `nym-node` version `1.1.3` onward is required to accept [**Operators Terms & Conditions**]({{toc_page}}) in order to be part of the active set. Make sure to read them before you add the flag.
```

There has been a long ongoing discussion whether and how to apply Terms and Conditions for Nym network operators, with an aim to stay aligned with the philosophy of Free Software and provide legal defense for both node operators and Nym developers. To understand better the reasoning behind this decision, you can listen to the first [Nym Operator Town Hall](https://www.youtube.com/live/7hwb8bAZIuc?si=3mQ2ed7AyUA1SsCp&t=915) introducing the T&Cs or to [Operator AMA with CEO Harry Halpin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIN-zYQw0I0) from June 4th, 2024, explaining pros and cons of T&Cs implementation.

Accepting T&Cs is done via a flag `--accept-operator-terms-and-conditions` added explicitly to `nym-node run` command every time. If you use [systemd](configuration.md#systemd) automation, add the flag to your service file's `ExecStart` line.

To check whether any node has T&Cs accepted or not can be done by querying Swagger API endpoint `/auxiliary_details` via one of these ports (depending on node setup):
```sh
# sustitude <NODE_IP_ADDRESS> or <NODE_DOMAIN> with a real one
http://<NODE_IP_ADDRESS>:8080/api/v1/auxiliary_details
https://<NODE_DOMAIN>/api/v1/auxiliary_details
http://<NODE_IP_ADDRESS>/api/v1/auxiliary_details
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="Example of `/auxiliary_details` query"
```sh
# substitude <NODE_IP_ADDRESS> with a real one
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://<NODE_IP_ADDRESS>:8080/api/v1/auxiliary-details' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'

{
  "location": "Kurdistan",
  "accepted_operator_terms_and_conditions": true
}
```
~~~

### Commands & Examples

**`nym-node` introduces a default human readible ID (local only) `default-nym-node`, which is used if there is not an explicit custom `--id <ID>` specified. All configuration is stored in `~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/config/config.toml` or `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/config/config.toml` respectively.**

```admonish info
All commands with more options listed below include `--accept-operator-terms-and-conditions` flag, read [Terms & Conditions](#terms--conditions) chapter above before executing these commands.
```

### Initialise & Run

When we use `run` command the node will do `init` as well, unless we specify with a flag `--deny-init`. Below are some examples of initialising and running `nym-node` with different modes (`--mode`) like `mixnode`, `entry-gateway`, `exit-gateway`.

Please keep in mind that currently you can run only one functionality (`--mode`) per a `nym-node` instance. We are yet to finalise implement the multi-functionality solution under one node bonded to one Nyx account. Every `exit-gateway` can function as `entry-gateway` by default, not vice versa.

```admonish success title=""
**We recommend operators to setup an [automation](configuration.md#systemd) flow for their nodes!**

In such case, you can `run` a node to initalise it or try if everything works, but then stop the proces and paste your entire `run` command syntax (below) to the `ExecStart` line of your `/etc/systemd/system/nym-node.service` and start the node as a [service](configuration.md#following-steps-for-nym-nodes-running-as-systemd-service).
```

```admonish note
To prevent over-flooding of our documentation we cannot provide with every single command syntax as there is a large combination of possibilities. Please use a common sense and the explanation in `--help` option.
```

#### Mode: `exit-gateway`

**Initialise and run** in one command:
```sh
# simple default
./nym-node  run  --mode exit-gateway

# with other options
./nym-node run --id <ID> --mode exit-gateway --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)" --hostname "<YOUR_DOMAIN>" --http-bind-address 0.0.0.0:8080 --mixnet-bind-address 0.0.0.0:1789 --location <COUNTRY_FULL_NAME> --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions --wireguard-enabled true

# <YOUR_DOMAIN> is in format without 'https://' prefix
# <COUNTRY_FULL_NAME> is format like 'Jamaica',  or two-letter alpha2 (e.g. 'JM'), three-letter alpha3 (e.g. 'JAM') or three-digit numeric-3 (e.g. '388') can be provided.
# wireguard can be enabled from version 1.1.6 onwards
```

**Initialise only** without running the node with `--init-only` command :

```sh
# simple default
./nym-node run --init-only --mode exit-gateway

# with a custom `--id` and other options
./nym-node run --id <ID> --init-only --mode exit-gateway --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)" --hostname "<YOUR_DOMAIN>" --http-bind-address 0.0.0.0:8080 --mixnet-bind-address 0.0.0.0:1789 --location <COUNTRY_FULL_NAME> --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions --wireguard-enabled true

# <YOUR_DOMAIN> is in format without 'https://' prefix
# <COUNTRY_FULL_NAME> is format like 'Jamaica',  or two-letter alpha2 (e.g. 'JM'), three-letter alpha3 (e.g. 'JAM') or three-digit numeric-3 (e.g. '388') can be provided.
# wireguard can be enabled from version 1.1.6 onwards
```

Run the node with custom `--id` without initialising, using `--deny-init` command
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --deny-init --mode exit-gateway --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions
```

#### Mode: `entry-gateway`

**Initialise and run:**
```sh
./nym-node run --mode entry-gateway
```

Initialise & run with all options
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --mode entry-gateway --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)" --hostname "<YOUR_DOMAIN>" --http-bind-address 0.0.0.0:8080 --mixnet-bind-address 0.0.0.0:1789 --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions --wireguard-enabled true

# <YOUR_DOMAIN> is in format without 'https://' prefix
# <COUNTRY_FULL_NAME> is format like 'Jamaica',  or two-letter alpha2 (e.g. 'JM'), three-letter alpha3 (e.g. 'JAM') or three-digit numeric-3 (e.g. '388') can be provided.
# wireguard can be enabled from version 1.1.6 onwards
```

Initialise only, with an `--init-only` command (a custom `--id` used):
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --init-only --mode entry-gateway --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)" --hostname "<YOUR_DOMAIN>" --http-bind-address 0.0.0.0:8080 --mixnet-bind-address 0.0.0.0:1789 --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions
```

Run the node with custom `--id` without initialising:
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --deny-init --mode entry-gateway --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions
```

#### Mode: `mixnode`

**Initialise and run:**
```sh
./nym-node run --mode mixnode
```

Initialise only with a custom `--id` and `--init-only` command:
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --init-only --mode mixnode --verloc-bind-address 0.0.0.0:1790 --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)" --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions
```

Run the node with custom `--id` without initialising:
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --deny-init --mode mixnode --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions
```




### Migrate

```admonish caution
Migration is a must for all deprecated nodes (`nym-mixnode`, `nym-gateway`). For backward compatibility we created an [archive section](../archive/nodes/setup-guides.md) with all the guides for individual binaries. However, the binaries from version 1.1.35 (`nym-gateway`) and 1.1.37 (`nym-mixnode`) onwards will no longer have `init` command.
```

Operators who are about to migrate their nodes need to configure their [VPS](vps-setup.md) and setup `nym-node` which can be downloaded as a [pre-built binary](../binaries/pre-built-binaries.md) or compiled from [source](../binaries/building-nym.md).

To migrate a `nym-mixnode` or a `nym-gateway` to `nym-node` is fairly simple, use the `migrate` command with `--config-file` flag pointing to the original `config.toml` file, with a conditional argument defining which type of node this configuration belongs to. Examples are below.

Make sure to use `--deny-init` flag to prevent initialisation of a new node.

#### Mode: `mixnode`
```sh
# move relevant infor from config.toml
./nym-node migrate --config-file ~/.nym/mixnodes/<MIXNODE_ID>/config/config.toml mixnode

# initialise with the new nym-node config
./nym-node run --mode mixnode --id <NYM-NODE_ID> --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions
```

#### Mode: `entry-gateway` and `exit-gateway`
```sh
# move relevant infor from config.toml
./nym-node migrate --config-file ~/.nym/gateways/<GATEWAY_ID>/config/config.toml gateway

# initialise with the new nym-node config - entry-gateway
./nym-node run --mode entry-gateway --id <NYM-NODE_ID> --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions

# or as exit-gateway
./nym-node run --id <NYM-NODE_ID> --mode exit-gateway --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)" --hostname "<YOUR_DOMAIN>" --http-bind-address 0.0.0.0:8080 --mixnet-bind-address 0.0.0.0:1789 --location <COUNTRY_FULL_NAME> --accept-operator-terms-and-conditions --wireguard-enabled false
```
