# Introduction

This is **Nym's Operators guide**, containing information and setup guides for the various components of Nym network and Nyx blockchain validators.

Nym network (also known as mixnet) routes and mixes packets through Gateways and Mixnodes, all run from the same binary called `nym-node`.

```ascii
                      ┌─►mix──┐  mix     mix
                      │       │
            Entry     │       │                   Exit
client ───► Gateway ──┘  mix  │  mix  ┌─►mix ───► Gateway ───► internet
                              │       │
                              │       │
                         mix  └─►mix──┘  mix
```

If you are new to Nym and want to learn about the Mixnet, explore kickstart options and demos, learn how to integrate with the network, and follow developer tutorials check out the [Developer Portal](https://nymtech.net/docs/developers/).
