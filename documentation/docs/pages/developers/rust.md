# Introduction
The Rust SDK allows developers building applications in Rust to import and interact with Nym clients as they would any other dependency, instead of running the client as a separate process on their machine.

Check the [development status](./rust/development-status) page to see the various modules that make up the SDK, and the [FFI](./rust/ffi) page for Go/C++ developers.
