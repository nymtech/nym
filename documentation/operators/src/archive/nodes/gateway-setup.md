# Gateways

```admonish warning
**This is an archived page for backwards compatibility for existing node operators. To start a new node or migrate, follow the [`nym-node` guides](../../nodes/nym-node.md).** The content of this page is not updated since April 19th 2024. Eventually this page will be terminated!
```

> The Nym gateway was built in the [building nym](../../binaries/building-nym.md) section. If you haven't yet built Nym and want to run the code, go there first.


```admonish info
As a result of [Project Smoosh](../faq/smoosh-faq.md), the current version of `nym-gateway` binary also contains `nym-network-requester` functionality which can be enabled [by the operator](./gateway-setup.md#initialising-gateway-with-network-requester). This combination is a basis of ***Nym Exit Gateway*** node - an essential piece in our new setup. Please read more in our [Project Smoosh FAQ](../faq/smoosh-faq.md) and [Exit Gateway](../../legal/exit-gateway.md) pages. We recommend operators begin to shift their setups to this new combined node, instead of operating two separate binaries.

## Current version

The last version before migration to [`nym-node`](../../nodes/nym-node.md) was `1.1.33`.

## Preliminary steps

Make sure you do the preparation listed in the [preliminary steps page](initial-steps.md) before setting up your Gateway.


## Gateway setup
Now that you have built the codebase, set up your wallet, and have a VPS with the `nym-gateway` binary, you can set up your gateway with the instructions below.

To begin, move to `/target/release` directory from which you run the node commands:

```
cd target/release
```

### Viewing command help
You can check that your binaries are properly compiled with:

```
./nym-gateway --help
```

You can also check the various arguments required for individual commands with:

```
./nym-gateway <COMMAND> --help
```
> Adding `--no-banner` startup flag will prevent Nym banner being printed even if run in tty environment.

## Initialising your Gateway

As Nym developers build towards [Exit Gateway](../../legal/exit-gateway.md) functionality, operators can now run their `nym-gateway` binary with inbuilt Network Requester and include the our new [exit policy](https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/exit-policy.txt). Considering the plan to [*smoosh*](../faq/smoosh-faq.md) all the nodes into one binary and have wide opened Exit Gateways, we recommend this setup, instead of operating two separate binaries.

```admonish warning
Before you start an Exit Gateway, read our [Operators Legal Forum](../../legal/exit-gateway.md) page and [*Project Smoosh FAQ*](../faq/smoosh-faq.md).
```

```admonish info
There has been an ongoing development with dynamic upgrades. Follow the status of the Project Smoosh [changes](../faq/smoosh-faq.md#what-are-the-changes) and the progression state of exit policy [implementation](../faq/smoosh-faq.html#how-will-the-exit-policy-be-implemented) to be up to date with the current design.
```

**Note:** Due to the development towards Exit Gateway functionality the `--host` flag has been replaced with `--listening-address`, this is the IP address which is used for receiving sphinx packets and listening to client data. Another flag `--public-ips` is required; it’s a comma separated list of IP’s that are announced to the `nym-api`, it is usually the address which is used for bonding.

### Initialising Exit Gateway

An operator can initialise the Exit Gateway functionality by adding Network Requester with the new exit policy option:

```
./nym-gateway init --id <ID> --listening-address 0.0.0.0 --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)" --with-network-requester --with-exit-policy true
```


You can see that the printed information besides *identity* and *sphinx keys* also includes a long string called *address*. This is the address to be provided to your local [socks5 client](https://nymtech.net/docs/clients/socks5-client.html) as a `--provider` if you wish to connect to your own Exit Gateway.

Additionally

#### Add Network Requester to an existing Gateway

If you already [upgraded](../../nodes/manual-upgrade.md) your Gateway to the [latest version](./gateway-setup.md#current-version) and initialised without a Network Requester, you can easily change its functionality to Exit Gateway with a command `setup-network-requester`.

See the options:

```
./nym-gateway setup-network-requester --help
```


To setup Exit Gateway functionality with our new [exit policy](https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/exit-policy.txt) add a flag `--with-exit-policy true`.

```
./nym-gateway setup-network-requester --enabled true --with-exit-policy true --id <ID>
```

Say we have a Gateway with `<ID>` as `new-gateway`, originally initialised and ran without the Exit Gateway functionality. To change the setup, run:


```
./nym-gateway setup-network-requester --enabled true --with-exit-policy true --id new-gateway
```


In case there are any unexpected problems, you can also change it manually by editing the Gateway config file stored in `/home/user/.nym/gateways/<ID>/config/config.toml` where the line under `[network_requester]` needs to be edited from `false` to `true`.

```
[network_requester]
# Specifies whether Network Requester service is enabled in this process.
enabled = true
```

Save, exit and restart your Gateway. Now you are an operator of post-smooshed Exit Gateway.

#### Enable Nym exit policy to an existing Gateway with Network Requester functionality

In case you already added Network Requester functionality to your Gateway as described above but haven't enabled the [exit policy](https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/exit-policy.txt) there is an easy tweak to do so and turn your node into [Nym Exit Gateway](../faq/smoosh-faq.md#what-are-the-changes).

Open the config file stored at `.nym/gateways/<ID>/config/network_requester_config.toml` and set:
```sh
use_deprecated_allow_list = false
```
Save, exit and restart your Gateway. Now you are an operator of post-smooshed Exit gateway.

```admonish info
All information about Network Requester part of your Exit Gateway is in `/home/user/.nym/gateways/<ID>/config/network_requester_config.toml`.
```

For now you can run Gateway without Network Requester or with and without the new exit policy. This will soon change as we inform in our [Project Smoosh FAQ](../faq/smoosh-faq.html#how-will-the-exit-policy-be-implemented).

To read more about the configuration like whitelisted outbound requesters in `allowed.list` and other useful information, see the page [*Network Requester whitelist*](network-requester-setup.md#using-your-network-requester).


#### Initialising Gateway without Network Requester

In case you don't want to run your Gateway with the Exit Gateway functionality, you still can run a simple Gateway.

To check available configuration options use:

```
 ./nym-gateway init --help
```

The following command returns a Gateway on your current IP with the `<ID>` of `simple-gateway`:

```
./nym-gateway init --id simple-gateway --listening-address 0.0.0.0 --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)"
```

The `$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)` command above returns your IP automatically using an external service. Alternatively, you can enter your IP manually if you wish. If you do this, remember to enter your IP **without** any port information.

## Running your Gateway

The `run` command starts the Gateway:

```
./nym-gateway run --id <ID>
```


## Bonding your Gateway

```admonish info
Before you bond your Gateway, please make sure the [firewall configuration](../../nodes/maintenance.md#configure-your-firewall) is setup so your Gateway can be reached from the outside. You can also setup WSS and automate your Gateway to simplify the operation overhead. We highly recommend to run any of these steps before bonding to prevent disruption of your Gateway's routing score later on.
```

### Via the Desktop wallet (recommended)

You can bond your Gateway via the Desktop wallet. **Make sure your Gateway is running first**, then follow the steps below:

1. Open your wallet, and head to the `Bonding` page, then select the node type `Gateway` and input your node details. Press `Next`.

2. Enter the `Amount`, `Operating cost` and press `Next`.

3. You will be asked to run a the `sign` command with your `gateway` - copy and paste the long signature `<PAYLOAD_GENERATED_BY_THE_WALLET>` and paste it as a value of `--contract-msg` in the following command:

```
./nym-gateway sign --id <YOUR_ID> --contract-msg <PAYLOAD_GENERATED_BY_THE_WALLET>
```

It will look something like this (as `<YOUR_ID>` we used `supergateway`):

> You are asked to `sign` a transaction on bonding so that the Mixnet smart contract is able to map your Nym address to your node. This allows us to create a nonce for each account and defend against replay attacks.

### Via the CLI (power users)

If you want to bond your Gateway via the CLI, then check out the [relevant section in the Nym CLI](https://nymtech.net/docs/tools/nym-cli.html#bond-a-mix-node) docs.
