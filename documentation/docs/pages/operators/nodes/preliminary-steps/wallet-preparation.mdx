# Nym Wallet Preparation

## Mainnet

Head to our [website](https://nymtech.net/download) and download the Nym wallet for your operating system. If pre-compiled binaries for your operating system aren't available, you can build the wallet yourself with instructions [here](https://nymtech.net/docs/wallet/desktop-wallet.html).

If you don't already have one, please create a Nym address using the wallet, and fund it with NYM tokens. The minimum amount required to bond a node is 100 `NYM`, but make sure you have a bit more to account for gas costs.

`NYM` can be purchased via [Bity](https://bity.com) from the wallet itself with BTC or fiat, and is currently present on several [exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nym#markets).

> Remember that you can **only** use Cosmos `NYM` tokens to bond your node. You **cannot** use ERC20 representations of `NYM` to run a node.


## Sandbox testnet

Make sure to download a wallet and create an account as outlined above. Then head to our [Sandbox Testnet page](../../sandbox.mdx#sandbox-token-faucet) and request testnet NYM tokens.
