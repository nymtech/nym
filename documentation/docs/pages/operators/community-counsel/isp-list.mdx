# Where to host your `nym-node`?

Inspired by a valuable resource, done by Tor community - [*Good Bad ISPs*](https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/good-bad-isps/), LunarDAO squad initiated a table customised for Nym Exit Gateways operators.

This ISP list is fully managed by Nym operator community and it serves as a space to share their experience of running Exit Gateways on various Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The ISPs greatly differ in regards to services they offer as well as to their openess of hosting exit routing software.

Please share any experiences running a node like policies, complains, legal issues and solutions, discrepancy between offers and reality (bandwidth, IP range, locations) or anything regarding pricing or customer support.

If you came across any legal findings, please share them in our [list of jurisdictions](jurisdictions.md).

While we trust that Nym node operators are honest, we would like to ask everyone to do your own research.
