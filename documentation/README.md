# Nym Docs v2

This is v2 of the nym docs, condensed from various mdbooks projects that we had previously.

These docs are hosted at [nymtech.net/docs](www.nymtech.net/docs).

## Doc projects
`docs/pages/` contains several subdirs, each hosting a subsection of the docs:
* `network` contains key concepts, cryptosystems, architecture.
* `developers` contains key concepts for developers, required architecture, and Rust/Typescript SDK docs.
* `operators` contains node setup and maintenance guides.

## Contribution
* If you wish to add to the documentation please create a PR against this repo, with a `patch` against `develop`.

## Scripts
* There are several autogenerated command files for clients and binaries. These are generated with `generate:commands`, which runs the `autodoc` rust binary, moves the files to their required places, and then if there is an update, commits them to git. This is for remote deployments.
* TODO

### Autodoc
`autodoc` is a script that generates markdown files containing commands and their output (both command and `--help` output). For the moment the binaries and their commands are manually configured in the script.

## CI/CD

## Licensing and copyright information
