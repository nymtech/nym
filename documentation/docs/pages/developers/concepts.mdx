# Core Concepts

We are working on making the Mixnet as easy as possible to use; that said, it is at the moment still quite an unusual system in terms of how it works and the required parts.

We are working on abstractions to emulate more traditional networking such as reading from / writing to TCP sockets, and have plans to modify the internals of the clients to remove some of the required architecture and slim down the parts required to use the Mixnet.
