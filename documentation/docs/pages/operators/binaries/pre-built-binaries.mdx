# Pre-built Binaries

This page is for operators who prefer to download ready made binaries. The [Github releases page](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases) has pre-built binaries which should work on Ubuntu 22.04 and other Debian-based systems, but at this stage cannot be guaranteed to work everywhere.

If the pre-built binaries don't work or are unavailable for your system, you will need to build the platform yourself.

## Setup Binaries

<VarInfo />

<Steps>

1. ###### Download binary
- Go to [Nym release page](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/), choose binary to download, click with a right button and `Copy Link...`
- Download from your terminal using `curl` or `wget` tool:
```sh
# using curl
curl -L <LINK> -o <PATH>/nym-node

# using wget
wget <LINK>
```
In case you want to download binary to your current working directory, drop `<PATH>` from the command

In case you want to download binary to your current working directory, drop `<PATH>` from the command

###### 2. Verify the binary `sha256sum` hash

<div>
  <Tabs items={[
    <strong>Manual check</strong>,
    <strong>One-liner</strong>,
    ]} defaultIndex="0">
    <MyTab>
To see your binary `sha256sum` hash, run: 
```sh
sha256sum <BINARY>
``` 
```sh
# for example 
# sha256sum ./nym-wallet_1.2.15_amd64.AppImage
# or
# sha256sum ./nym-node
```
- Download [`hashes.json`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases) file from the same same *Assets* drop down like your binary
- Open it with your text editor or print its content with `cat hashes.json`
- Check it if your binary `sha256sum` output is in `hashes.json` by using the `sha256sum` and searching for it or using `grep` command:
```
grep -i <SHA_HASH> 
```
    </MyTab>
    <MyTab>
- Download [`hashes.json`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases) file from the same same *Assets* drop down like your binary
- Run this command, substituting `<BINARY>` with your the one you want to check:
```sh
sha256sum <BINARY> | awk '{print $1}' | grep -qF "$(jq -r '.assets | to_entries | .[].value.sha256' hashes.json)" && echo "Hash matches an asset in the JSON file." || echo "Hash does not match any asset in the JSON file."
```
```sh
# for example
# sha256sum ./nym-node | awk '{print $1}' | grep -qF "$(jq -r '.assets | to_entries | .[].value.sha256' hashes.json)" && echo "Hash matches an asset in the JSON file." || echo "Hash does not match any asset in the JSON file."
```
    </MyTab>
  </Tabs>
</div>

- If your have to extract the binary (it would look like like `<BINARY>.tar.gz`) do it:
```sh
tar -xvzf <BINARY>.tar.gz
```

###### 3. Make the binary executable
- Open terminal in the same directory and run:
```sh
chmod u+x <BINARY>
# for example: chmod u+x nym-node
```

</Steps>

Now you can use your binary. Follow the guide according to the type of your binary.

* [Nym Nodes](../nodes/nym-node.mdx)
* [Validators](../nodes/validator-setup.mdx)

You can reconfigure your binaries at any time by editing the config file located at `~/.nym/<BINARY_TYPE>/<ID>/config/config.toml` and restarting the binary process.

`<ID>` represents a local moniker that is **never** transmitted over the network. It's used to select which local config and key files (stored in `./nym`) to use for startup.
