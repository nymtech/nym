# dependencies to review:
futures = "0.3" # bunch of futures stuff, however, now that I think about it, it could perhaps be completely removed
# the AsyncRead, AsyncWrite, Stream, Sink, etc. traits could be used from tokio
# channels should really be replaced with crossbeam due to that implementation being more efficient
# and the single instance of abortable we have should really be refactored anyway
url = "2.1" # I think we should just replace it with String

clap = "2.33.0" # for the command line arguments
dirs = "3.0" # for determining default store directories in config
dotenv = "0.15.0" # for obtaining environmental variables (only used for RUST_LOG for time being)
log = "0.4" # self explanatory
pretty_env_logger = "0.3" # for formatting log messages
rand = {version = "0.7.3", features = ["wasm-bindgen"]} # rng-related traits + some rng implementation to use
serde = { version = "1.0.104", features = ["derive"] } # for config serialization/deserialization
sled = "0.33" # for storage of replySURB decryption keys
tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] } # async runtime
