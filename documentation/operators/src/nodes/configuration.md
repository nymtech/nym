# Nym Node Configuration

## Basic Changes

Nym Node can be configured directly by editing the config file (`config.toml`) located at `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/config/config.toml` (by default `~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/config/config.toml`) or through commands on the binary.

### Commands & Examples

Disable sharing of system hardware info with the network:

```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --deny-init --mode entry-gateway -w --expose-system-hardware false --expose-system-info false
```

Note: `--expose-system-info false` supersedes `--expose-system-hardware false`. If both are present with conflicting values, the system hardware will not be shown.


## VPS Setup and Automation

> Replace `<NODE>` variable with type of node you run, preferably `nym-node` (depreciated `nym-mixnode`, `nym-gateway` or `nym-network-requester`).

### Automating your node with nohup, tmux and systemd

Although itâ€™s not totally necessary, it's useful to have the Mix Node automatically start at system boot time. We recommend to run your remote operation via [`tmux`](maintenance.md#tmux) for easier management and a handy return to your previous session. For full automation, including a failed node auto-restart and `ulimit` setup, [`systemd`](maintenance.md#systemd) is a good choice.

> Do any of these steps and run your automated node before you start bonding process!

#### nohup

`nohup` is a command with which your terminal is told to ignore the `HUP` or 'hangup' signal. This will stop the node process ending if you kill your session.

```sh
nohup ./<NODE> run <OTHER_FLAGS> # use all the flags you use to run your node
```

#### tmux

One way is to use `tmux` shell on top of your current VPS terminal. Tmux is a terminal multiplexer, it allows you to create several terminal windows and panes from a single terminal. Processes started in `tmux` keep running after closing the terminal as long as the given `tmux` window was not terminated.

Use the following command to get `tmux`.

| Platform | Install Command |
| :---      | :---             |
| Arch Linux|`pacman -S tmux`             |
| Debian or Ubuntu|`apt install tmux`      |
| Fedora|`dnf install tmux`                 |
| RHEL or CentOS|`yum install tmux`          |
|  macOS (using Homebrew | `brew install tmux`    |
| macOS (using MacPorts) | `port install tmux`    |
|               openSUSE | `zypper install tmux`  |

In case it didn't work for your distribution, see how to build `tmux` from [version control](https://github.com/tmux/tmux#from-version-control).

**Running tmux**

Now you have installed tmux on your VPS, let's run a Mix Node on tmux, which allows you to detach your terminal and let your `<NODE>` run on its own on the VPS.

* Pause your `<NODE>`
* Start tmux with the command
```sh
tmux
```
* The tmux terminal should open in the same working directory, just the layout changed into tmux default layout.
* Start the `<NODE>` again with a command:
```sh
./<NODE> run <OTHER_FLAGS> # use all the flags you use to run your node
```
* Now, without closing the tmux window, you can close the whole terminal and the `<NODE>` (and any other process running in tmux) will stay active.
* Next time just start your teminal, ssh into the VPS and run the following command to attach back to your previous session:
```sh
tmux attach-session
```
* To see keybinding options of tmux press `ctrl`+`b` and after 1 second `?`

#### systemd

To automate with `systemd` use this init service file by saving it as `/etc/systemd/system/nym-node.service` and follow the [next steps](#following-steps-for-nym-nodes-running-as-systemd-service).

1. Open text editor
```sh
nano /etc/systemd/system/nym-node.service
```

2. Paste this file
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Nym Node
StartLimitInterval=350
StartLimitBurst=10

[Service]
User=<USER>
LimitNOFILE=65536
ExecStart=/home/<USER>/<PATH>/nym-node run # add all the flags you use to run your node
KillSignal=SIGINT
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Save the file


```admonish note
Make sure your `ExecStart <FULL_PATH>` and `run` command are correct!

Example: If you have built nym in the `$HOME` directory on your server, your username is `jetpanther`, and node `<ID>` is `puma`, then the `ExecStart` line (command) in the script located in `/etc/systemd/system/nym-mixnode.service` for Nym Mixnode might look like this:
`ExecStart=/home/jetpanther/nym/target/release/nym-node run --id puma`.

Basically, you want the full `/<PATH>/<TO>/nym-mixnode run --id <WHATEVER-YOUR-NODE-ID-IS>`. If you are unsure about your `/<PATH>/<TO>/<NODE>`, then `cd` to your directory where you run your `<NODE>` from and run `pwd` command which returns the full path for you.
```


#### Following steps for Nym nodes running as `systemd` service

Once your init file is save follow these steps:

1. Reload systemctl to pickup the new unit file
```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
```

2. Enable the newly created service:

```sh
systemctl enable nym-node.service
```

3. Start your `<NODE>` as a `systemd` service:

```sh
service nym-node start
```

This will cause your `<NODE>` to start at system boot time. If you restart your machine, your `<NODE>` will come back up automatically.

**Useful systemd commands**

- You can monitor system logs of your node by running:
```sh
journalctl -u nym-node -f
```

- Or check a status by running:
```sh
systemctl status <NODE>.service
# for example systemctl status nym-node.service
```

- You can also do `service <NODE> stop` or `service <NODE> restart`.

**Note:** if you make any changes to your `systemd` script after you've enabled it, you will need to run:

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
```

This lets your operating system know it's ok to reload the service configuration. Then restart your `<NODE>`.
