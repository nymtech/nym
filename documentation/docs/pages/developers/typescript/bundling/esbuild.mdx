# Troubleshooting bundling with ESbuild

If you've been following the steps outlined in the Examples section, your development environment should be configured as follows:

#### Environment Setup
Begin by creating a directory and configuring your application environment:

Create your directory and set-up your app environment:
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
During the environment setup, choose React and subsequently opt for Typescript if you want your application to function smoothly following this tutorial. Next, navigate to your application directory and run the following commands:
```bash
cd < YOUR_APP >
npm i 
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm install @nymproject/< PACKAGE_NAME >
```
