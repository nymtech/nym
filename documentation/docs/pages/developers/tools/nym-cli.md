# Nym-CLI

This is a CLI tool for interacting with:

* the Nyx blockchain (account management, querying the chain state, etc)
* the smart contracts deployed on Nyx (bonding and un-bonding mixnodes, collecting rewards, etc)

It provides a convenient wrapper around the `nymd` client, and has similar functionality to the `nyxd` binary for querying the chain or executing smart contract methods.
