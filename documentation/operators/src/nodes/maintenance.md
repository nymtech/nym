## Useful commands

> Adding `--no-banner` startup flag will prevent Nym banner being printed even if run in tty environment.

**build-info**

A `build-info` command prints the build information like commit hash, rust version, binary version just like what command `--version` does. However, you can also specify an `--output=json` flag that will format the whole output as a json, making it an order of magnitude easier to parse.

For example `./target/debug/nym-network-requester --no-banner build-info --output json` will return:

```sh
{"binary_name":"nym-network-requester","build_timestamp":"2023-07-24T15:38:37.00657Z","build_version":"1.1.23","commit_sha":"c70149400206dce24cf20babb1e64f22202672dd","commit_timestamp":"2023-07-24T14:45:45Z","commit_branch":"feature/simplify-cli-parsing","rustc_version":"1.71.0","rustc_channel":"stable","cargo_profile":"debug"}
```

## Configure your firewall

Although your `<NODE>` is now ready to receive traffic, your server may not be. The following commands will allow you to set up a firewall using `ufw`.

```sh
# check if you have ufw installed
ufw version

# if it is not installed, install with
sudo apt install ufw -y

# enable ufw
sudo ufw enable

# check the status of the firewall
sudo ufw status
```

Finally open your `<NODE>` p2p port, as well as ports for ssh and ports for verloc and measurement pings:

```sh
# for nym-node
sudo ufw allow 1789,1790,8000,9000,9001,22/tcp

# in case of setting up WSS on Gateway add:
sudo ufw allow 9001/tcp

# In case of reverse proxy for the Gateway swagger page add:
sudo ufw allow 8080,80/443

# for validator
sudo ufw allow 1317,26656,26660,22,80,443/tcp
```

Check the status of the firewall:
```sh
sudo ufw status
```

For more information about your node's port configuration, check the [port reference table](./maintenance.md#gateway-port-reference) below.

## VPS Setup and Automation

> Replace `<NODE>` variable with type of node you run, preferably `nym-node` (depreciated `nym-mixnode`, `nym-gateway` or `nym-network-requester`).

### Automating your node with nohup, tmux and systemd

Although itâ€™s not totally necessary, it's useful to have the Mix Node automatically start at system boot time. We recommend to run your remote operation via [`tmux`](maintenance.md#tmux) for easier management and a handy return to your previous session. For full automation, including a failed node auto-restart and `ulimit` setup, [`systemd`](maintenance.md#systemd) is a good choice.

> Do any of these steps and run your automated node before you start bonding process!

#### nohup

`nohup` is a command with which your terminal is told to ignore the `HUP` or 'hangup' signal. This will stop the node process ending if you kill your session.

```sh
nohup ./<NODE> run <OTHER_FLAGS> # use all the flags you use to run your node
```

#### tmux

One way is to use `tmux` shell on top of your current VPS terminal. Tmux is a terminal multiplexer, it allows you to create several terminal windows and panes from a single terminal. Processes started in `tmux` keep running after closing the terminal as long as the given `tmux` window was not terminated.

Use the following command to get `tmux`.

| Platform | Install Command |
| :---      | :---             |
| Arch Linux|`pacman -S tmux`             |
| Debian or Ubuntu|`apt install tmux`      |
| Fedora|`dnf install tmux`                 |
| RHEL or CentOS|`yum install tmux`          |
|  macOS (using Homebrew | `brew install tmux`    |
| macOS (using MacPorts) | `port install tmux`    |
|               openSUSE | `zypper install tmux`  |

In case it didn't work for your distribution, see how to build `tmux` from [version control](https://github.com/tmux/tmux#from-version-control).

**Running tmux**

Now you have installed tmux on your VPS, let's run a Mix Node on tmux, which allows you to detach your terminal and let your `<NODE>` run on its own on the VPS.

* Pause your `<NODE>`
* Start tmux with the command
```sh
tmux
```
* The tmux terminal should open in the same working directory, just the layout changed into tmux default layout.
* Start the `<NODE>` again with a command:
```sh
./<NODE> run <OTHER_FLAGS> # use all the flags you use to run your node
```
* Now, without closing the tmux window, you can close the whole terminal and the `<NODE>` (and any other process running in tmux) will stay active.
* Next time just start your teminal, ssh into the VPS and run the following command to attach back to your previous session:
```sh
tmux attach-session
```
* To see keybinding options of tmux press `ctrl`+`b` and after 1 second `?`

#### systemd

> Configuration of `systemd` service files for `nym-node` is under [Nym Node - Configuration](configuration.md#systemd) page.

##### For Nymvisor
> Since you're running your node via a Nymvisor instance, as well as creating a Nymvisor `.service` file, you will also want to **stop any previous node automation process you already have running**.

To automate with `systemd` use this init service file by saving it as `/etc/systemd/system/nymvisor.service` and follow the [next steps](#following-steps-for-nym-nodes-running-as-systemd-service).

1. Open text editor
```sh
nano /etc/systemd/system/nymvisor.service
```

2. Paste this file

```
[Unit]
Description=Nymvisor <VERSION>
StartLimitInterval=350
StartLimitBurst=10

[Service]
User=<USER> # replace this with whatever user you wish
LimitNOFILE=65536
ExecStart=/home/<USER>/<PATH>/nymvisor run --id <ID>
KillSignal=SIGINT
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Save the file

```admonish note
Make sure your `ExecStart <FULL_PATH>` and `run` command are correct!

Example: If you have built nym in the `$HOME` directory on your server, your username is `jetpanther`, and node `<ID>` is `puma`, then the `ExecStart` line (command) in the script located in `/etc/systemd/system/nym-mixnode.service` for Nym Mixnode might look like this:
`ExecStart=/home/jetpanther/nym/target/release/nym-node run --id puma`.

Basically, you want the full `/<PATH>/<TO>/nym-mixnode run --id <WHATEVER-YOUR-NODE-ID-IS>`. If you are unsure about your `/<PATH>/<TO>/<NODE>`, then `cd` to your directory where you run your `<NODE>` from and run `pwd` command which returns the full path for you.
```


#### Following steps for Nym nodes running as `systemd` service

Once your init file is save follow these steps:

1. Reload systemctl to pickup the new unit file
```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
```

2. Enable the newly created service:

```sh
systemctl enable nym-node.service
```

3. Start your `<NODE>` as a `systemd` service:

```sh
service nym-node start
```

This will cause your `<NODE>` to start at system boot time. If you restart your machine, your `<NODE>` will come back up automatically.

**Useful systemd commands**

- You can monitor system logs of your node by running:
```sh
journalctl -u <NODE> -f
```

- Or check a status by running:
```sh
systemctl status <NODE>.service
# for example systemctl status nym-node.service
```

- You can also do `service <NODE> stop` or `service <NODE> restart`.

**Note:** if you make any changes to your `systemd` script after you've enabled it, you will need to run:

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
```

This lets your operating system know it's OK to reload the service configuration. Then restart your `<NODE>`.


## Backup a node

Anything can happen to the server on which your node is running. To back up your `nym-node` keys and configuration protects the operators against the negative impact of unexpected events. To restart your node on another server, two essential pieces are needed:

1. Node keys to initialise the same node on a new VPS
2. Access to the bonding Nym account (wallet seeds) to edit the IP on smart contract

Assuming that everyone access their wallets from local machine and does *not* store their seeds on VPS, point \#2 should be a given. To backup your `nym-node` keys and configuration in the easiest way possible, copy the entire config directory `.nym` from your VPS to your local desktop, using a special copy command `scp`:

1. Create a directory where you want to store your backup
```sh
mkdir -pv <PATH_TO_TARGET_DIRECTORY>
```

2. Copy configuration folder `.nym` from your VPS to your newly created backup directory:

```sh
scp -r <SOURCE_USER_NAME>@<SOURCE_HOST_ADDRESS>:~/.nym/nym-nodes/<YOUR_NODE_ID> <PATH_TO_TARGET_DIRECTORY>
```

3. The `scp` command should print logs, an operator can see directly whether it was successful or if it encountered any error. However, double check that all your needed configuration is in the backup directory.

## Restoring a node

In case your VPS shut down and you have a [backup](#backup-a-node) of your node keys and access to your bonding wallet, you can easily restore your node on another server without losing your delegation.

1. On VPS: Do all [preliminary steps](preliminary-steps.md) needed to run a `nym-node`.

2. On VPS: Create a `.nym/nym-nodes` configuration folder:
```sh
mkdir -pv ~/.nym/nym-nodes
```

3. From machine where your node is backed up (usually local desktop): Copy the folder with your node keys and configuration to the newly created folder on your VPS using `scp` command. Make sure to grab the entire `nym-node` configuration folder, which is called after your local `nym-node` ID, the `-r` flag will take care of all sub-directories and their content:
```sh
scp -r <LOCAL_NODE_CONFIGURATION_FOLDER> <VPS_USER_NAME>@<VPS_HOST_ADDRESS>:~/.nym/nym-nodes/
```

4. The `scp` command should print logs, an operator can see directly whether it was successful or if it encountered any error. However, double check that all your needed configuration is in the target directory `.nym/nym-nodes` on your VPS.


5. Configure your node on the new VPS:

* Edit `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/config/config.toml` config with the new listening address IP - it's the one under the header `[host]`, called `public_ips = ['<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>',]` and add your new location (field `location = <LOCATION>`, formats like: 'Jamaica', or two-letter alpha2 (e.g. 'JM'), three-letter alpha3 (e.g. 'JAM') or three-digit numeric-3 (e.g. '388') can be provided). You can see your IP by running a command `echo "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)"`.
* Try to run the node and see if everything works.
* Setup the [systemd](#systemd) automation (don't forget to add the [terms and conditions flag](setup.md#terms--conditions)) to `ExecStart` command, reload the daemon and run the service.

6. And finally change the node smart contract info via the wallet interface. Open Nym Wallet, go to *Bonding*, open *Gateway Settings* or *Mixnode Settings* and change *Host* value to the new `nym-node` IP address. Otherwise the keys will point to the old IP address in the smart contract, and the node will not be able to be connected, and it will fail up-time checks, returning zero performance.

## Moving a node

In case of a need to move a Nym Node from one machine to another and avoiding to lose the delegation, here are few steps how to do it.

Assuming both machines are remote VPS.

* Make sure your `~/.ssh/<YOUR_KEY>.pub` is in both of the servers `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file
* Create a `nym-nodes` folder in the target VPS. SSH in from your terminal and run:

```sh
# in case none of the nym configs was created previously
mkdir ~/.nym

#in case no nym Nym Node was initialized previously
mkdir ~/.nym/nym-nodes
```
* Move the node data (keys) and config file to the new machine by opening your **local terminal** (as that one's ssh key is authorized in both of the VPS) and running:
```sh
scp -r -3 <SOURCE_USER_NAME>@<SOURCE_HOST_ADDRESS>:~/.nym/nym-nodes <TARGET_USER_NAME>@<TARGET_HOST_ADDRESS>:~/.nym/nym-nodes/
```

**On new/target VPS**

* Edit `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/config/config.toml` config with the new listening address IP - it's the one under the header `[host]`, called `public_ips = ['<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>',]` and add your new location (field `location = <LOCATION>`, formats like: 'Jamaica', or two-letter alpha2 (e.g. 'JM'), three-letter alpha3 (e.g. 'JAM') or three-digit numeric-3 (e.g. '388') can be provided). You can see your IP by running a command `echo "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)"`.
* Try to run the node and see if everything works.
* Setup the [systemd](#systemd) automation. If you want to use the exact same service config file, you can also copy it from one VPS to another following the same logic by opening your **local terminal** (as that one's ssh key is authorized in both of the VPS) and running:
```sh
scp -r -3 <SOURCE_USER_NAME>@<SOURCE_HOST_ADDRESS>:/etc/systemd/system/nym-node.service <TARGET_USER_NAME>@<TARGET_HOST_ADDRESS>:/etc/systemd/system/nym-node.service
```

Note: [Accepting T&Cs](setup.md#terms--conditions) is done via a flag `--accept-operator-terms-and-conditions` added explicitly to `nym-node run` command every time. If you use [systemd](configuration.md#systemd) automation, add the flag to your service file's `ExecStart` line.

**In your desktop wallet**

* Change the node smart contract info via the wallet interface. Open Nym Wallet, go to *Bonding*, open *Gateway Settings* or *Mixnode Settings* and change *Host* value to the new `nym-node` IP address. Otherwise the keys will point to the old IP address in the smart contract, and the node will not be able to be connected, and it will fail up-time checks, returning zero performance.

Make sure to stop the old node.

## Rename node local ID

Local node ID (not the identity key) is a name chosen by operators which defines where the nodes configuration data will be stored, where the ID determines the path to `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/`. This ID is never shared on the network.

Since migrating to [`nym-node`](nym-node.md), specifying an with `--ID <ID>` when starting a new node is no longer necessary. Nodes without a specified ID will be asigned the default ID `default-nym-node`. This streamlines node management, particularly for operators handling multiple nodes via ansible and other automation scripts, as all data is stored at `~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node`.

If you already operate a `nym-node` and wish to change the local ID to `default-nym-node` or anything else, follow the steps below to do so.

```admonish note
In the example we use `default-nym-node` as a target `<ID>`, if you prefer to use another name, edit the syntax in the commands accordingly.
```

1. Copy the configuration directory to the new one
```sh
cp -r  ~/.nym/nym-nodes/<SOURCE_ID> ~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/
```

2. Rename all `<SOURCE_ID>` occurences in `config.toml` to `default-nym-node`

```sh
# check occurences of the <SOURCE_ID>
grep -r  "<SOURCE_ID>" ~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/*
```
```admonish bug title="Caution!"
If your node `<SOURCE_ID>` is too generic (like `gateway` etc) and it occurs elsewhere than just a custom value, **do not use `sed` command but rewrite the values manually using a text editor!**
```

```sh
# rename it by using sed command
sed -i -e "s/<SOURCE_ID>/default-nym-node/g" ~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/config/config.toml

# or manually by opening config.toml and rewriting each occurence of <SOURCE_ID>
nano ~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/config/config.toml
```

3. Validate by rechecking the config file content
```sh
# either re-run
grep -r  "<SOURCE_ID>" ~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/*

# or by reading the config file
less ~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/config/config.toml
```
- Pay extra attention to the `hostname` line. In case its value was somehow correlated with the `<SOURCE_ID>` string you may need to correct it back

4. Reload your [systemd service daemon](#systemd) and restart the service, or if automation isn't your thing, simply reboot the node

5. If you double-checked that everything works fine, you can consider removing your old config directory

## Ports
