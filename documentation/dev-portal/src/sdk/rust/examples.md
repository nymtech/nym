# Examples

All the following examples can be found in the `nym-sdk` [examples directory](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/master/sdk/rust/nym-sdk/examples) in the monorepo. Just navigate to `nym/sdk/rust/nym-sdk/examples/` and run the files from there with: 

```sh 
cargo run --example <NAME_OF_FILE>
```

If you wish to run these outside of the workspace - such as if you want to use one as the basis for your own project - then make sure to import the `sdk`, `tokio`, and `nym_bin_common` crates.  

An example `Cargo.toml` file can be found [here](examples/cargo.md).
