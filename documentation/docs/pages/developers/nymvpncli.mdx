# Nym VPN CLI

This is a short guide to setting up and using the `nym-vpnc` tool, which is used in conjunction with the `nym-vpnd` daemon.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  These binaries have superceded the older `nym-vpn-cli` binary. This still operates for the moment as it is being used in testing scenarios but will go out of date quickly.
</Callout>

Download and run instructions for the GUIs can be found [here](https://nymvpn.com/en/download/linux).

## Download & Extract Binary
Check the [release page](https://github.com/nymtech/nym-vpn-client/releases/) page for the latest release version and modify the instructions accordingly. These instructions use the latest as of the time of writing.
```sh
wget -q https://github.com/nymtech/nym-vpn-client/releases/download/nym-vpn-core-v1.1.0-beta.3/nym-vpn-core-v1.1.0-beta.3_<YOUR_OPERATING_SYSTEM>.tar.gz &&
tar -xzf nym-vpn-core-v1.1.0-beta.3_<YOUR_OPERATING_SYSTEM>.tar.gz &&
cd nym-vpn-core-v1.1.0-beta.3_<YOUR_OPERATING_SYSTEM>/ &&
chmod u+x *
```

## Build from Source
### Prerequisites
All operating systems require both [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).

**Arch specific packages:**
```sh
yay -S gcc make protobuf base-devel clang
```

**Ubuntu24 specific packages:**
```sh
apt install gcc make protobuf-compiler pkconfig libdbus-1-dev build-essential clang
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Older Debian/Ubuntu versions need to manually install `protobuf-compiler` >= v3.21.12
</Callout>

### Clone & `make`
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nymtech/nym-vpn-client.git
cd nym-vpn-client/
make
```

## Mnemonic Generation
Create an account at [nymvpn.com](nymvpn.com) to obtain your mnemonic.

## Start the daemon
```sh
sudo ./PATH/TO/nym-vpnd
```

If you are running for the first time you will see the following:

```sh

```

Ignore the `NoAccountStored` errors: these will disappear after the next step. **Leave the daemon running and run the following commands in another terminal window** or create an init file for `nym-vpnd`.

## Run VPN
We have to first store the account we have created online:
```sh
./PATH/TO/nym-vpn-cli store-account --mnemonic "<MNEMONIC_FROM_GENERATION_STEP>"
```

You will see this registration in the daemon logs:

```sh

```

You can then connect `nym-vpnc` (in this case, with 2 hop wireguard mode enabled):
```sh
./PATH/TO/nym-vpn-cli nym-vpnc connect --enable-two-hop
```

Which shows as such in the daemon logs:

You should see the `Remaining wireguard bandwidth` decrease as you use your allowance.

There are a lot of configuration options available to you regarding how to connect:

```sh
❯ ./nym-vpn-core/target/debug/nym-vpnc connect --help
Connect to the Nym network

Usage: nym-vpnc connect [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --entry-gateway-id <ENTRY_GATEWAY_ID>
          Mixnet public ID of the entry gateway
      --entry-gateway-country <ENTRY_GATEWAY_COUNTRY>
          Auto-select entry gateway by country ISO
      --entry-gateway-low-latency
          Auto-select entry gateway by latency
      --entry-gateway-random
          Auto-select entry gateway randomly
      --exit-router-address <EXIT_ROUTER_ADDRESS>
          Mixnet recipient address
      --exit-gateway-id <EXIT_GATEWAY_ID>
          Mixnet public ID of the exit gateway
      --exit-gateway-country <EXIT_GATEWAY_COUNTRY>
          Auto-select exit gateway by country ISO

          Auto-select exit gateway randomly
      --dns <DNS>
          Set the IP address of the DNS server to use
      --disable-routing
          Disable routing all traffic through the nym TUN device. When the flag is set,
          the nym TUN device will be created, but to route traffic through it you will
          need to do it manually, e.g. ping -Itun0
      --enable-two-hop
          Enable two-hop wireguard traffic. This means that traffic jumps directly from
          entry gateway to exit gateway using Wireguard protocol
  -w, --wait-until-connected
          Blocks until the connection is established or failed
      --netstack
          Use netstack based implementation for two-hop wireguard
      --enable-credentials-mode
          Enable credentials mode
      --min-gateway-mixnet-performance <MIN_GATEWAY_MIXNET_PERFORMANCE>
          An integer between 0 and 100 representing the minimum gateway performance
          required to consider a gateway for routing traffic
      --min-gateway-vpn-performance <MIN_GATEWAY_VPN_PERFORMANCE>
          An integer between 0 and 100 representing the minimum gateway performance
          required to consider a gateway for routing traffic
  -h, --help
          Print help
