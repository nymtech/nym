# Loopix
The Nym Mixnet is based upon the [Loopix](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00536) design.

This design lays out a stratified design of several layers of Mix Nodes and Gateways in which:
- Traffic path selection is chosen independently per-message, unlike designs such as Onion routing.
- Messages are routed through an ingress Gateway, 3 layers of Mix Nodes, and an egress Gateway, where each node is connected only to adjecent layers.
- Continuous-time mixing is employed, wherein connected clients and nodes continuously generate packets that are sent into the network. This generation can by modeled by a Poisson process. Whether a packet contains a user-defined payload or not defines the difference between 'real' and 'cover' traffic but it is impossible to make this distinction by just monitoring the traffic flow itself by an observer.
