          "title": "What is NymVPN?",
          "description": "NymVPN is a privacy-focused network-protection product that combines Nym's secure mixnet technology with a decentralized WireGuard VPN for comprehensive online privacy across all use cases."
        },
        {
          "title": "What makes NymVPN different from traditional VPNs?",
          "description": "NymVPN distinguishes itself with its distinctive blend of a mixnet and a decentralized VPN. By design, and in contrast to traditional VPNs, NymVPN cannot access user data or browsing history, nor link traffic to personal information, such as email or payment details. NymVPN also distinguishes itself with a multi-hop routing by default. This combination offers unparalleled online privacy and security across all online use cases. Check our [NymVPN litepaper](https://nymvpn.com/nymVPN-litepaper.pdf) for more detailed information."

          "title": "What makes NymVPN different from other decentralized VPNs?",
          "description": "NymVPN distinguishes itself with its distinctive blend of a mixnet and a multi-hop decentralized VPN. It stands out by relying on a truly decentralized set of nodes run by worldwide-distributed operators, empowered to participate in the structuring of the network via a democractic community governance. NymVPN also ensures private payments thanks to zero-knowledge proof access enabled by zk-nyms. Check our [NymVPN litepaper](https://nymvpn.com/nymVPN-litepaper.pdf) for more detailed information."

        {
          "title": "What makes NymVPN different from Tor and other onion/garlic routers?",
          "description": "Tor stands out in the decentralized privacy landscape. But relying on volunteer-run nodes, it can suffer from inconsistent reliability and be subject to Sybil attacks, compromising its integrity. NymVPN incentivization scheme for node operators addresses both these issues. Moreover, NymVPN defeats timing analysis, a Tor vulnerability, with its packet shuffling and users cover traffic to obscure communication patterns. This combination offers a cutting-edge solution for users seeking the highest level of privacy. Check our [NymVPN litepaper](https://nymvpn.com/nymVPN-litepaper.pdf) for more detailed information."
