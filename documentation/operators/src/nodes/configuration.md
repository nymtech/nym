# Nym Node Configuration

## Basic Changes

Nym Node can be configured directly by editing the config file (`config.toml`) located at `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/config/config.toml` (by default `~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/config/config.toml`) or through commands on the binary.

### Commands & Examples

Disable sharing of system hardware info with the network:

```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --deny-init --mode entry-gateway -w --expose-system-hardware false --expose-system-info false
```

Note: `--expose-system-info false` supersedes `--expose-system-hardware false`. If both are present with conflicting values, the system hardware will not be shown.


## VPS Setup and Automation

> Replace `<NODE>` variable with type of node you run, preferably `nym-node` (depreciated `nym-mixnode`, `nym-gateway` or `nym-network-requester`).

### Automating your node with nohup, tmux and systemd

Although itâ€™s not totally necessary, it's useful to have the Mix Node automatically start at system boot time. We recommend to run your remote operation via [`tmux`](maintenance.md#tmux) for easier management and a handy return to your previous session. For full automation, including a failed node auto-restart and `ulimit` setup, [`systemd`](maintenance.md#systemd) is a good choice.

> Do any of these steps and run your automated node before you start bonding process!

#### nohup

`nohup` is a command with which your terminal is told to ignore the `HUP` or 'hangup' signal. This will stop the node process ending if you kill your session.

```sh
nohup ./<NODE> run <OTHER_FLAGS> # use all the flags you use to run your node
```

#### tmux

One way is to use `tmux` shell on top of your current VPS terminal. Tmux is a terminal multiplexer, it allows you to create several terminal windows and panes from a single terminal. Processes started in `tmux` keep running after closing the terminal as long as the given `tmux` window was not terminated.

Use the following command to get `tmux`.

| Platform | Install Command |
| :---      | :---             |
| Arch Linux|`pacman -S tmux`             |
| Debian or Ubuntu|`apt install tmux`      |
| Fedora|`dnf install tmux`                 |
| RHEL or CentOS|`yum install tmux`          |
|  macOS (using Homebrew | `brew install tmux`    |
| macOS (using MacPorts) | `port install tmux`    |
|               openSUSE | `zypper install tmux`  |

In case it didn't work for your distribution, see how to build `tmux` from [version control](https://github.com/tmux/tmux#from-version-control).

**Running tmux**

Now you have installed tmux on your VPS, let's run a Mix Node on tmux, which allows you to detach your terminal and let your `<NODE>` run on its own on the VPS.

* Pause your `<NODE>`
* Start tmux with the command
```sh
tmux
```
* The tmux terminal should open in the same working directory, just the layout changed into tmux default layout.
* Start the `<NODE>` again with a command:
```sh
./<NODE> run <OTHER_FLAGS> # use all the flags you use to run your node
```
* Now, without closing the tmux window, you can close the whole terminal and the `<NODE>` (and any other process running in tmux) will stay active.
* Next time just start your teminal, ssh into the VPS and run the following command to attach back to your previous session:
```sh
tmux attach-session
```
* To see keybinding options of tmux press `ctrl`+`b` and after 1 second `?`

#### systemd

To automate with `systemd` use this init service file by saving it as `/etc/systemd/system/nym-node.service` and follow the [next steps](#following-steps-for-nym-nodes-running-as-systemd-service).

1. Open text editor
```sh
nano /etc/systemd/system/nym-node.service
```

2. Paste this file
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Nym Node
StartLimitInterval=350
StartLimitBurst=10

[Service]
User=<USER>
LimitNOFILE=65536
ExecStart=/home/<USER>/<PATH>/nym-node run # add all the flags you use to run your node
KillSignal=SIGINT
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Save the file

```admonish note
Make sure your `ExecStart <FULL_PATH>` and `run` command are correct!

Example: If you have built nym in the `$HOME` directory on your server, your username is `jetpanther`, and node `<ID>` is `puma`, then the `ExecStart` line (command) in the script located in `/etc/systemd/system/nym-mixnode.service` for Nym Mixnode might look like this:
`ExecStart=/home/jetpanther/nym/target/release/nym-node run --id puma`.

Basically, you want the full `/<PATH>/<TO>/nym-mixnode run --id <WHATEVER-YOUR-NODE-ID-IS>`. If you are unsure about your `/<PATH>/<TO>/<NODE>`, then `cd` to your directory where you run your `<NODE>` from and run `pwd` command which returns the full path for you.
```


#### Following steps for Nym nodes running as `systemd` service

Once your init file is save follow these steps:

1. Reload systemctl to pickup the new unit file
```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
```

2. Enable the newly created service:

```sh
systemctl enable nym-node.service
```

3. Start your `<NODE>` as a `systemd` service:

```sh
service nym-node start
```

This will cause your `<NODE>` to start at system boot time. If you restart your machine, your `<NODE>` will come back up automatically.

**Useful systemd commands**

- You can monitor system logs of your node by running:
```sh
journalctl -u nym-node -f
```

- Or check a status by running:
```sh
systemctl status <NODE>.service
# for example systemctl status nym-node.service
```

- You can also do `service <NODE> stop` or `service <NODE> restart`.

**Note:** if you make any changes to your `systemd` script after you've enabled it, you will need to run:

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
```

This lets your operating system know it's ok to reload the service configuration. Then restart your `<NODE>`.


## Connectivity Test and Configuration

```admonish info
**This chapter is relevant only for operators running `entry-gateway` and `exit-gateway` mode.**
```

With embedded Network Requester and IP Packet Router (modules routing data for the Mixnet and NymVPN traffic), there are more connectivity requirements on `nym-node` VPS setup. While we're working on Rust implementation to have these settings as a part of the binary build, in the meantime we wrote two scripts [`nym_network_diagnostics.sh`](https://gist.github.com/tommyv1987/a5fb30f5966e9d7bfbce58d88a85c0c1) and [`enable_networking_for_nym_nodes.sh`](https://gist.github.com/tommyv1987/ccf6ca00ffb3d7e13192edda61bb2a77) to support the operators to configure their servers.

1. Download `nym_network_diagnostics.sh`, make executable and run:

```sh
curl -s -L -o gateway_network_check.sh https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tommyv1987/a5fb30f5966e9d7bfbce58d88a85c0c1/raw/27acbdbeecf9e04a0faee6a96e717aa7231935ef/nym_network_diagnostics.sh && chmod u+x gateway_network_check.sh  && ./gateway_network_check.sh
```
~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="An overview of `gateway_network_check.sh` flow"
```sh
. check ipv4 forwarding status: displays whether ipv4 packet forwarding is enabled on the system.
. check ipv6 forwarding status: shows the status of ipv6 packet forwarding.
. check ufw firewall status: if the ufw (uncomplicated firewall) command is available, it prints the verbose status of the ufw firewall. if ufw is not found, it informs the user.
. identify default network device: finds and displays the default network interface used for internet connectivity. if not found, it reports an error and exits.
. inspect ipv4 firewall rules: lists ipv4 firewall rules that are relevant to forwarding and specifically checks for rules involving "nymtun0" or related to ufw's reject rules for forwarding.
. inspect ipv6 firewall rules: similar to ipv4, but for ipv6 firewall rules, checking for forwarding rules that involve "nymtun0" or are related to ufw's reject rules.
. examine ipv4 routing table: prints the current ipv4 routing table, showing how ipv4 traffic is routed on the device.
. examine ipv6 routing table: shows the ipv6 routing table, detailing the routing of ipv6 traffic.
. check ipv4 connectivity: performs a ping test to google.com with ipv4 to verify internet connectivity.
. check ipv6 connectivity: similar to the ipv4 check but uses ipv6 to ping google.com, verifying ipv6 internet access.
. check internet and mixnet connectivity (ipv4) via nymtun0: tests ipv4 connectivity through the "nymtun0" interface by fetching a joke from an online api. if a joke is returned, it indicates successful connectivity.
. check internet and mixnet connectivity (ipv6) via nymtun0: tests ipv6 connectivity through "nymtun0". if no globally routable ipv6 address is found, it advises on potential actions. if an address is found, it attempts to fetch a joke to confirm connectivity.
```
~~~

  - To run the test next time, just enter `./gateway-network-check.sh`

2. Check out the outcome. The important parts are:
  - Status `1` on the `IPv4` and `IPv6 forwarding status`
  - `IPv4` and `IPv6 firewall rules` showing `state RELATED, ESTABLISHED`
  - Running `ping` on `IPv4` and `IPv6`
  - `checking internet and mixnet connectivity (IPv4) via nymtun0...` working
  - `checking internet and mixnet connectivity (IPv6) via nymtun0...` working
  - Below is an example correct outcome of the test

```
~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="An overview of `enable_network_diagnostics.sh` flow"
```sh
overview:
script usage guide & function invocation: offers a command-line interface for executing specific script functions based on user input, providing flexibility in network configuration and diagnostics.

logic flow:

- it finds the default network device and set up tunnel_interface: identifies the internet-facing interface and sets a variable for a specified tunnel interface.
- install persistent iptables: updates the system's package list and installs the iptables-persistent package, ensuring firewall rules are maintained after reboot.

the functions:

- adjust ipv6 forwarding: modifies sysctl.conf to ensure ipv6 forwarding is enabled, making changes as necessary based on the current configuration.
- apply iptables ipv4 rule: establishes nat (network address translation) and forwarding rules for ipv4 traffic, facilitating packet forwarding between the tunnel interface and the internet.
- apply iptables ipv6 rule: sets up ipv6 forwarding rules and enables ipv6 packet forwarding, calling the function to adjust ipv6 forwarding settings.
- remove iptables ipv4 rule: removes previously set nat and forwarding rules for ipv4, reverting changes made to iptables.
- remove iptables ipv6 rule: clears ipv6 forwarding rules and disables ipv6 packet forwarding, undoing modifications to ip6tables.
- check ipv6 & ipv4 forwarding status: verifies whether packet forwarding for both ipv4 and ipv6 is active, reporting the status.
- inspect nymtun iptables rules: outputs current ipv4 and ipv6 firewall rules, focusing particularly on those affecting the tunnel interface.
- test internet & mixnet connectivity via nymtun (ipv4 & ipv6): attempts to confirm connectivity through the tunnel interface by fetching jokes over ipv4 and ipv6, serving as a practical connectivity test.
- apply all iptables rules for nymtun: executes functions to set iptables rules for both ipv4 and ipv6, configuring the system for packet forwarding.
- remove all iptables rules for ipv6 & ipv4: executes functions to clear all iptables modifications related to packet forwarding.
-

summary:
this is a comprehensive script for configuring network packet forwarding and iptables rules,
aimed at ensuring smooth operation of a tunnel interface.
it includes functionality for both setup and tear-down of nymtun network configurations,
alongside diagnostics for verifying system settings and network connectivity.
```

  - You can also make a sanity check, by running this test as separated steps:
```sh
sudo ./enable_networking_for_nym_nodes.sh check_nymtun_iptables

sudo ./enable_networking_for_nym_nodes.sh apply_all_iptable_rules_nymtun
```

4. After running `enable_network_diagnostics.sh`, re-run `./gateway-network-check.sh` and check the outcome. If there are still problems, please refer to [troubleshooting section](../troubleshooting/vps-setup.md#incorrect-gateway-network-check)

If all the setup went smooth, your server is ready to connect `nym-node` with the rest of the Mixnet. There are a few more good suggestions for `nym-node` VPS configuration, especially to be considered for Gateway functionality, like Web Secure Socket or Reversed Proxy setup. Visit [Proxy configuration](proxy-configuration) page to see the guides.
