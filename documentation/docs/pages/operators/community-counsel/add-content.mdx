# Adding Content to Legal Forum

Our aim is to establish a strong community network, sharing legal findings and other suggestions with each other. We would like to encourage all of the current and future operators to do research about the situation in the jurisdiction they operate in, to share solutions to the challenges they encountered when running Exit Gateway, and create a pull request (PR).

First of all, please join our [Node Operators Legal Forum](https://matrix.to/#/!YfoUFsJjsXbWmijbPG:nymtech.chat?via=nymtech.chat&via=matrix.org) (Matrix chat) and post any information or questions there.

To add your information to this book, you can create a PR directly to our [repository](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/documentation/operators/src/legal).
