# Integration Options
If you've already gone through the different options and had a look at the tutorials, you have seen the possibilities available to you for quickly connecting existing application code to another Nym process. 

Below are a resources that will be useful for either beginning to integrate mixnet functionality into existing application code or build a new app using Nym.  

- **We suggest you begin with this [integration decision tree](https://sdk.nymtech.net/integrations)**. This will give you a better idea of what pieces of software (SDKs, standalone clients, service providers) your integration might involve, and what is currently possible to do with as little custom code as possible. 

- The [integrations FAQ](../faq/integrations-faq.md) has a list of common questions regarding integrating with Nym and Nyx, as well as commonly required links. 

> If you wish to integrate with the Nyx blockchain to use `NYM` for payments, start with the [payment integration](./payment-integration.md) page.
