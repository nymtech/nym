# Nym Clients

A large proportion of the Nym mixnet's functionality is implemented client-side.

Clients perform the following actions on behalf of users:

* determine network topology - what nodes exist, their public encryption keys, etc.
* register with a gateway
* authenticate with a gateway
* receive and decrypt messages from the gateway
* create layer-encrypted Sphinx packets LINK
* send Sphinx packets with real messages
* send Sphinx packet _cover traffic_ when no real messages are being sent LINK
* retransmit un-acknowledged packet sends - if a client sends 100 packets to a gateway, but only receives an acknowledgement ('ack') for 95 of them, it will resend those 5 packets to the gateway again, to make sure that all packets are received.

> at the moment due to the fact that the mixnet is primarily message based LINK, this requires another client on the 'other side' of the mixet to send packets to, unless you're using the `nymvpn` client (part of the NymVPN app) or the `socks5` client, which operates as a SOCKS4,4a, or 5 proxy. In the future we wish to remove this point of friction and have all nym clients construct IP packets.

## Types of Nym clients
At present, there are three Nym clients:

- the websocket (native) client
- the SOCKS5 client
- the wasm (webassembly) client

You need to choose which one you want incorporate into your app. Which one you use will depend largely on your preferred programming style and the purpose of your app.

> Technically there is a fourth client used by the NymVPN app: certain bits of functionality such as the creation of IP packets will be pulled into the three other clients in the future.

### The websocket client
Your first option is the native websocket client (`nym-client`). This is a compiled program that can run on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows machines. It can be run as a persistent process on a desktop or server machine. You can connect to it with **any language that supports websockets**.

> Rust developers can import websocket client functionality into their code via the [Rust SDK](../sdk/rust/rust.md).

### The webassembly client
If you're working in JavaScript or Typescript in the browser, or building an [edge computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing) app, you'll likely want to choose the webassembly client.

It's packaged and [available on the npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/nym-client-wasm), so you can `npm install` it into your JavaScript or TypeScript application.

> The webassembly client is most easily used via the [Typescript SDK](../sdk/typescript.md). Typescript developers who wish to send API requests through the mixnet can can also check the [`mixfetch`]() package.

### The SOCKS5 client
The `nym-socks5-client` is useful for allowing existing applications to use the Nym mixnet without any code changes. All that's necessary is that they can use one of the SOCKS5, SOCKS4a, or SOCKS4 proxy protocols (which many applications can - crypto wallets, browsers, chat applications etc).

When used as a standalone client, it's less flexible as a way of writing custom applications than the other clients, but able to be used to proxy application traffic through the mixnet without having to make any code changes.

_Rust developers can import socks client functionality into their code via the [Rust SDK](../sdk/rust/rust.md)_.

## Commonalities between clients
All Nym client packages present basically the same capabilities to the privacy application developer. They need to run as a persistent process in order to stay connected and ready to receive any incoming messages from their gateway nodes. They register and authenticate to gateways, encrypt/decrypt Sphinx packets, and produce and send cover traffic LINK.
