Just a todo file to keep track of what should be changed

- Deriving challenges and oracles should be more streamlined; perhaps some trait for hashing
- perhaps there could be additional intermediate types in proofs of knowledge (for moves / responses / etc)



- IDEA: hide almost everything as private and only expose 'Dealing'
