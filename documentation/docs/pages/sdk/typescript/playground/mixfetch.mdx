<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Right now Gateways are not required to run a Secure Websocket (WSS) listener, so only a subset of nodes running in Gateway mode have configured their nodes to do so.

  For the moment you have to select a Gateway that has WSS enabled from [this list](https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/v1/services?wss=true).

  You can also find WSS-enabled nodes by querying the `gateways/described` endpoint on the Nym API and filtering for `wss_port`, either via the [Swagger webpage](https://validator.nymtech.net/api/swagger/index.html) or with `curl`:

  ```
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/gateways/described' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
  ```
