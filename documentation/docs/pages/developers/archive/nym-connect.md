# Archive page: NymConnect Setup

```admonish warning
Since the beginning of 2024 NymConnect is no longer maintained. Nym is developing a new client called [NymVPN](https://nymvpn.com), an application routing all users traffic thorugh the mixnet.
If users want to route their traffic through socks5 we advice to use maintained [Nym Socks5 Client](../clients/socks5/setup.md).
```

In case you want to run deprecated NymConnect, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to our [Github repository](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases?q=nym-connect&expanded=true) and download NymConnect binary
2. On Linux and Mac, make executable by opening terminal in the same directory and run:

```sh
chmod +x ./nym-connect_<VERSION>.AppImage
```

1. Start the application
2. Click on `Connect` button to initialise the connection with the Mixnet
3. Anytime you'll need to setup Host and Port in your applications, click on `IP` and `Port` to copy the values to clipboard
4. In case you have problems such as `Gateway Issues`, try to reconnect or restart the application

## Connect Privacy Enhanced Applications (PEApps)

Here are some examples of applications which will work behind Socks5 proxy (`nym-socks5-client` or deprecated NymConnect), to enhance users privacy.

### Electrum Bitcoin wallet via NymConnect

To download Electrum visit the [official webpage](https://electrum.org/#download). To connect to the Mixnet follow these steps:

1. Start and connect NymConnect (or [`nym-socks5-client`](../clients/socks5/setup.md))
2. Start your Electrum Bitcoin wallet
3. Go to: *Tools* -> *Network* -> *Proxy*
4. Set *Use proxy* to âœ…, choose `SOCKS5` from the drop-down and add (copy-paste) the values from your NymConnect application
5. Now your Electrum Bitcoin wallet runs through the Mixnet and it will be connected only if your NymConnect or `nym-socks5-client` are connected.

### Monero wallet via NymConnect

To download Monero wallet visit [getmonero.org](https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/). To connect to the Mixnet follow these steps:

1. Start and connect NymConnect (or [`nym-socks5-client`](../clients/socks5/setup.md))
2. Start your Monero wallet
3. Go to: *Settings* -> *Interface* -> *Socks5 proxy* -> Add values: IP address `127.0.0.1`, Port `1080` (the values copied from NymConnect)
5. Now your Monero wallet runs through the Mixnet and it will be connected only if your NymConnect or `nym-socks5-client` are connected.


### Matrix (Element) via NymConnect

To download Element (chat client for Matrix) visit [element.io](https://element.io/download). To connect to the Mixnet follow these steps:

1. Start and connect NymConnect (or [`nym-socks5-client`](../clients/socks5/setup.md))
2. Start `element-desktop` with `--proxy-server` argument:

**Linux**

```sh
element-desktop --proxy-server=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
```

**Mac**

```sh
open -a Element --args --proxy-server=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
```

To make the start of Element over NymConnect simplier, you can add this command to your key-binding shortcuts in your system settings.

### Telegram via NymConnect

1. Start and connect NymConnect (or [`nym-socks5-client`](../clients/socks5/setup.md))
2. Start your Telegram chat application
3. Open the Telegram proxy settings.
    - Linux: *Settings* -> *Advanced* -> *Connection type* -> *Use custom proxy*
    - MacOS: *Settings* -> *Advanced* -> *Data & Storage* ->  *Connection Type* -> *Use custom Proxy*
    - Windows: *Settings* -> *Data and Storage* -> *Use proxy*
4. Add a proxy with the *Add proxy button*.
5. Select *SOCKS5* and make sure the port details are the same as those generated by NymConnect. Alternatively, follow this link: [https://t.me/socks?server=127.0.0.1&port=1080](https://t.me/socks?server=127.0.0.1&port=1080)
6. *Save the proxy settings* in Telegram.
7. Telegram is now running through the Nym Mixnet and is privacy-enhanced! This allows you to connect from regions which blocked Telegram.
8. Note if you remain idle on Telegram for a while you might lose connectivity and your messages might not get through via SOCKS5 proxy. If that happens reconnect your NymConnect and reset the proxy again.
