# Nym API Setup

> The nym-api binary was built in the [building nym](../../binaries/building-nym.mdx) section. If you haven't yet built Nym and want to run the code, go there first. You can build just the API with `cargo build --release --bin nym-api`.

<VarInfo />

## What is the Nym API?

The Nym API is a binary that will be operated by the Nyx validator set. This binary can be run in several different modes, and has two main bits of functionality:

* Network monitoring (calculating the routing score of Mixnet nodes)
* Generation and validation of [zk-nyms](https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a), our implementation of the Coconut Selective Disclosure Credential Scheme.

This is important for both the proper decentralisation of the network uptime calculation and, more pressingly, enabling the NymVPN to utilise privacy preserving payments.

The process of enabling these different aspects of the system will take time. At the moment, Nym API operators will only have to run the binary in a minimal 'caching' mode in order to get used to maintaining an additional process running alongside a full node.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
It is highly recommended to run `nym-api` alongside a full node and NOT a validator node, since you will be exposing HTTP port(s) to the Internet. We also observed degradation in p2p and block signing operations when `nym-api` was run alongside a signing validator.
</Callout>

### Rewards

Operators of Nym API will be rewarded for performing the extra work of taking part in credential generation. These rewards will be calculated **separately** from rewards for block production.

Rewards for credential signing will be calculated hourly, with API operators receiving a proportional amount of the reward pool (333NYM per hour / 237,600 NYM per month), proportional to the percentage of credentials they have signed.

### Hardware Requirements

The specification mentioned below is for running a full node alongside the nym-api. It is recommended to run `nym-api` and a full Nyx node on the same machine for optimum performance.

Bear in mind that credential signing is primarily CPU-bound, so choose the fastest CPU available to you.

#### Minimum Requirements

| Hardware | Minimum Specification                      |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| CPU      | 8-cores, 2.8GHz base clock speed or higher |
| RAM      | 16GB DDR4+                                 |
| Disk     | 500 GiB+ NVMe SSD                          |

#### Recommended Requirements

| Hardware | Minimum Specification                       |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| CPU      | 16-cores, 2.8GHz base clock speed or higher |
| RAM      | 32GB DDR4+                                  |
| Disk     | 1 TiB+ NVMe SSD                             |

### Full node configuration

To install a full node from scratch, refer to the [validator setup guide](../validator-setup.mdx) and follow the steps outlined there.

Additionally, to ensure `nym-api` works as expected, ensure the configuration is as below:

<Steps>

1. ###### Ensure transaction index is turned on in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[tx_index]

# Ensure that this is not set to "null". You're free to use any indexer

indexer = "kv"
```

2. ###### Ensure pruning settings are manually configured

`nym-api` needs to check validity of user-submitted transactions (in the past) while issuing credentials and as part of double-spend check. Hence, aggressively pruning data will lead to errors with your `nym-api`

Make sure your pruning settings are configured as below in `app.toml`:

```toml
pruning = "custom"

# This number is likely to be updated once zk-nym signing goes live
pruning-keep-recent = "750000"
pruning-interval = "100"
```

The example value of `100` for `pruning-interval` can be customised as per your requirement.

</Steps>

### Credential Generation

Validators that took part in the DKG ceremony became part of the 'quorum' generating and verifying zk-nym credentials. These will initially be used for private proof of payment for NymVPN (see our blogposts [here](https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-an-invitation-for-privacy-experts-and-enthusiasts-63644139d09d) and [here](https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a) for more on this), and in the future will be expanded into more general use-cases such as [offline ecash](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08221).

The DKG ceremony was used to create a subset of existing validators who run `nym-api` alongside a Nyx full-node. As outlined above, they are the ones taking part in the generation and verification of zk-nym credentials. The size of the 'minimum viable quorum' is 10 - the intial set taking part in DKG was 17 validators. This is in order to have some redundancy in the case of a validator dropping or going offline.

DKG ceremony in points:

* The deployment and initialisation of [`group`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/contracts/multisig/cw4-group) and [`multisig`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/contracts/multisig) contracts by Nym. Validators that are members of the `group` contract are the only ones that were able to take part in the ceremony.
* The deployment and initialisation of an instance of the [DKG contract](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/contracts/coconut-dkg) by Nym.
* Validators updated their `nym-api` configs with the address of the deployed contracts. They  also stopped running their API instance in caching only mode, instead switching over run with the `--enabled-credentials-mode`.
* From the perspective of validator operators, this is all they had to do. Under the hood, each `nym-api` instance then took part in several rounds of key submission, verification, and derivation. This will continue until quorum is acheived.

## Setup and Usage

### Viewing command help
You can check that your binary is properly compiled with:

```bash
./nym-api --help
```

Which should return a list of all available commands.

<NymApiHelp />

You can also check the various arguments required for individual commands with:

```bash
./nym-api <COMMAND> --help
```

### Initialising your Nym API Instance in caching mode

Initialise your API instance with:

```bash
./nym-api init
```

You can optionally pass a local identifier for this instance with the `--id` flag. Otherwise the ID of your instance defaults to `default`.

### Enabling credential signing on your Nym API instance

To engage in the Distributed Key Generation (DKG) ceremony, it's essential to transition your `nym-api` instance from its default caching mode to the active credential signing mode. This section guides you through the process of enabling credential signing

#### Generate a new wallet

Begin by generating a new wallet address specifically for your instance to use in credential signing mode. Utilize the `nyxd` command-line tool with the following command:

```bash
nyxd keys add signer
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
It's critical to securely back up the mnemonic phrase generated during this process. This mnemonic is your key to recovering the wallet in the future, so store it in a secure, offline location.
</Callout>

#### Fund the address

Next, deposit NYM tokens into the newly created wallet address to ensure it can cover transaction fees incurred during the credential signing process. `nym-api` will not operate if the wallet's balance falls below 10 NYM tokens, displaying an error message upon startup.

We recommend beginning with an initial deposit of 100 NYM tokens and monitoring the balance regularly, topping it up as necessary to maintain operational readiness.

#### Update API configuration

With your new wallet ready and funded, proceed to update your `nym-api` configuration to enable credential signing:

Update your `config.toml` located in `$HOME/.nym/nym-api/foo/config/config.toml` as below:

Enable the coconut signer:

```toml
[coconut_signer]
# Specifies whether coconut signing protocol is enabled in this process.
enabled = true  # This was previously false
```

Set your announce address if it is empty. This is the URL you previously configured for your `nym-api` instance

```toml
# This is the address you previously configured for the nym-api
# Not to be confused with the Cosmos REST API URL
announce_address = 'https://nym-api.your.tld/'
```

Finally, input the mnemonic phrase generated during the wallet creation step into the mnemonic field

```toml
mnemonic = '<YOUR_MNEMONIC>'
```

After completing these steps, your `nym-api` instance is configured to participate in credential signing and the DKG ceremony.

### Running your Nym API Instance

The API binary currently defaults to running in caching mode. You can run your API with:

```bash
./nym-api run --id <ID>
```

By default the API will be trying to query your full node running locally on `localhost:26657`. If your node is hosted elsewhere, you can specify the RPC location by using the `--nyxd-validator ` flag on `run`:

```bash
./nym-api run --id <ID> --nyxd-validator https://rpc-nym.yourcorp.tld:443
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
You can also change the value of `local_validator` in the config file found by default in `$HOME/.nym/nym-api/<ID>/config/config.toml`.
</Callout>

This process is quite noisy, but informative:

## Automation

You will most likely want to automate your validator restarting if your server reboots. Checkout the [maintenance page](nyx-configuration.mdx#nym-api-systemd-automation) for an example `service` file.

You can also use `nymvisor` to automatically update the `nym-api` node. The steps to install Nymvisor can be found [here](../maintenance/nymvisor-upgrade.mdx).

## Exposing web endpoint using HTTPS
It is recommended to expose the webserver over HTTPS by using a webserver like Nginx. An example configuration for configuring Nginx is listed on [Reverse proxy page](../nym-node/configuration/proxy-configuration.mdx). If you're using a custom solution, ensure to allow requests from anywhere by setting a permissive CORS policy.

For example, it is configured in Nginx using: `add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '*';`
