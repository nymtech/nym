### Where do I go from here? 💭

For more in-depth information on the network architecture, head to the [Network Overview page](https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/network-overview.html), and check out the [Operators book](https://nymtech.net/operators) if you want to run a node yourself. 

If you would like to concentrate on building an application that uses the mixnet:
* Explore the [Quickstart](../quickstart/overview.md) options.
* Check out examples of [Community Apps](../community-resources/community-applications-and-guides.md). 
* Run through the [Rust SDK](../tutorials/archive/setups/rust-sdk.md) or [Typescript](../tutorials/archive/setups/typescript.md) tutorials.
