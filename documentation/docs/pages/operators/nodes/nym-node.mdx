# Nym Node


NYM NODE is a tool for running a node within the Nym network. Nym Nodes containing functionality such as `mixnode`, `entry-gateway` and `exit-gateway` are fundamental components of Nym Mixnet architecture. Nym Nodes are ran by decentralised node operators.

To setup any type of Nym Node, start with either building [Nym's platform](../binaries/building-nym.mdx) from source or download [pre-compiled binaries](../binaries/pre-built-binaries.mdx) on the [configured server (VPS)](preliminary-steps/vps-setup.mdx) where you want to run the node. Your Nym Node will need to be bonded before it can be run. We recommend most users use the [Nym desktop wallet](preliminary-steps/wallet-preparation.mdx) for this.

**Follow [preliminary steps](preliminary-steps.mdx) page before you configure and run a `nym-node`!**

## Steps for Nym Node Operators

Once [VPS and Nym wallet are configured](preliminary-steps.mdx), binaries ready, the operators of `nym-node` need to:

1. **[Setup](nym-node/setup.mdx) the node**

2. **[Configure](nym-node/configuration.mdx) the node and optionally automation, Wireguard, WSS, reversed proxy ...**

3. **[Run](nym-node/setup.mdx#initialise--run) the node or [the service](nym-node/configuration.md#systemd)**

4. **[Bond](nym-node/bonding.mdx) the node to the Nym API, using Nym wallet**

Make sure to follow the steps thoroughly, in case you find any point difficult don't hesitate to ask in our [Operators channel](https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat).
