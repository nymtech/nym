# Simple Send 
Lets look at a very simple example of how you can import and use the websocket client in a piece of Rust code (`examples/simple.rs`).

Simply importing the `nym_sdk` crate into your project allows you to create a client and send traffic through the mixnet.

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../../../../../sdk/rust/nym-sdk/examples/simple.rs}}
```
