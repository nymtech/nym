# Overview

There are multiple options to quickly connect to Nym and play with both the mixnet and credentials on the Sandbox testnet.

At most, these involve running Nym as a second process alongside an existing application in order to send traffic through the mixnet, most are either interact webpages or a standalone app.

If you've already covered the information in this section, or want to jump straight into integrating/ a Nym connection into an existing application, head to the [Integrations](../integrations/integration-options.md) section.
