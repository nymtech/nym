**This page contains some tips & tricks to support operators running Exit Gateway (`nym-node` in mode `exit-gateway`) gathered by the operators community. Have a look on the points below to strengthen your legal protection.**

## Useful Suggestions

#### Introduce Nym Node to your provider
Write a message to your provider telling them about your intention to run a `nym-node` on their infrastructure. You can use this template for it.

#### Use a friendly provider
Nym operators community shares their experience with different ISPs on [this page](isp-list). At the same time, consider to move away from these provides:

- Servinga / VPS2day (AS39378)
- Frantech / Ponynet / BuyVM (AS53667)
- Online S.A.S. / Scaleway (AS12876)
- Hetzner Online GmbH (AS24940)
- 1337 Services GmbH / RDP.sh (AS210558)
- Stark Industries Solutions Ltd. / PQ.Hosting / The.Hosting / UFO-AS (AS44477 / ASN 33993)

#### Backup your nodes
Your only way to restore your node is when you have an access to `.nym` directory locally. Follow [node](../nodes/maintenance#backup-a-node) and [proxy configuration](../nodes/maintenance#backup-proxy-configuration) backup guides to be able to [restore your node](../nodes/maintenance#restoring-a-node) on another machine later on, without losing your delegation.

#### Use `nym-exit` prefix on your landing page URL
We would like to ask operators to use [reverse proxy](../nodes/nym-node/configuration/proxy-configuration) with a [landing page](landing-pages). When assigning a domain please use a common convention with `nym-exit` in the beginning of the the page URL as this will create a reputation and reference. The entire address should have this new format:
```
nym-exit.<CUSTOM>.<DOMAIN>.<TLD>
```

For example:

```
# for squads running multiple nodes a format can look like this:
nym-exit.ch-node1.mysquad.org

# or like this
nym-exit.3-jamaica.mysquad.org

# for operators having one node per location, the format can look like this:
nym-exit.brazil.mysquad.org

# or if operators decide to not have any custom, they can simply have this format:
nym-exit.mysquad.org
```

**The `NYM-EXIT` part in the beginning is what's important.**

#### Chose the right TLD
When registering a domain, check [Top Level Domain (TLD)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1348/top-level-domain-tld) terms and conditions. For example `.icu` is a no go. Having a wrong TLD may lead to your domain being taken away from you when facing a DMCA report.

#### Respond to abuse reports
Make sure to read notifications from your account provider and if you receive an abuse report, respond to it in time. Here is a template explaining the essential legal background of Nym Node Exit Gateway. Don't forget to adjust the variables.
