# Explorer API

The Explorer API is the backend for the [Mixnet Explorer](https://explorer.nymtech.net/).

**This will soon be deprecated in favour of the [Node Status API](../ns-api).**

The code for this service can be found [in our monorepo](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/explorer).
