# Licensing

Components that make up Nym as a system are licensed individually, so for accurate information, please check individual files.

As a general approach, licensing is as follows this pattern:
- applications and binaries are GPLv3
- libraries and components are Apache 2.0 or MIT
- documentation is Apache 2.0 or CC0-1.0

Again, for accurate information, please check individual files.
