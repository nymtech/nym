Flow showing:
  - setting up Nym client logging
  - creating an ephemeral Nym client (no key storage / persistent address - this will come in a future iteration)
  - getting its [Nym address](https://nymtech.net/docs/clients/addressing-system.html)
  - using that address to send a message to yourself via the Mixnet
  - listen for and parse the incoming message for the `sender_tag` used for [anonymous replies with SURBs]	(https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/traffic-flow.html#private-replies-using-surbs)
  - send a reply to yourself using SURBs

	// replying to incoming message (from ourselves) with SURBs - note that sending a message to a recipient and
	// replying to an incoming are different functions: replying relies on parsing the incoming sender_tag on the Rust
	// side and creating an AnonymousSenderTag type, instead of the Recipient type which relies on a nym address
	//
	// you will see in the client logs that there are requests for more SURBs that we send to ourselves to
	// be able to fit the full reply message in there. In a future iteration of this code we can also expose
	// a send() which allows for developers to dictate the number of SURBs to send along with their outgoing message
