# Nym Clients

A large proportion of the Nym mixnet's functionality is implemented client-side.

Clients perform the following actions on behalf of users:

* determine network topology - what nodes exist, their public encryption keys, etc.
* register with a gateway
* authenticate with a gateway
* receive and decrypt messages from the gateway
* create layer-encrypted Sphinx packets LINK
* send Sphinx packets with real messages
* send Sphinx packet _cover traffic_ when no real messages are being sent LINK
* retransmit un-acknowledged packet sends - if a client sends 100 packets to a gateway, but only receives an acknowledgement ('ack') for 95 of them, it will resend those 5 packets to the gateway again, to make sure that all packets are received.

> At the moment due to the fact that Nym clients are message-based LINK, using the Mixnet requires another client on the 'other side' of the mixet to send packets to, unless you're using the `nymvpn` client (part of the NymVPN app) or the `socks5` client, which operates as a SOCKS4,4a, or 5 proxy and is able to utilise the client embedded within the `nym-node`'s Exit Gateway functionality (prev. this functionality was a standalone service, the Network Requester). In the future we wish to remove this point of friction and have all Nym clients construct IP packets instead, easing the integration burden and abstracting away the message-based nature of client communication.

TODO breakdown of client:
- startup
- gateway connection
- auth
- message sending
- poisson process
