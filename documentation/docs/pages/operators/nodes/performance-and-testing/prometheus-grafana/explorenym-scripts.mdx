# ExploreNym Monitoring Scripts

This setup and the scripts included were not written by Nym developers. As always do your own audit before installing any scripts on your machine and familiarize yourself with the security risks involved when opening ports or allowing http access.

## Community Monitoring Tools

Individual operators, node families and squads are the foundation of distributed network. There has been a great number of tools coming out of this community some of which can be deployed for the node monitoring setup.

## ExploreNYM Tools

Long term involved operator Pawnflake, an author of [ExploreNYM](https://explorenym.net/) explorer, created a monitoring flow, which can be used by other operators called [`self-hosted-monitor`](https://github.com/ExploreNYM/self-hosted-monitor). It utilises bash scripts to enable operators setup [Prometheus](https://github.com/ExploreNYM/self-hosted-monitor/blob/main/prometheus.sh) and [Grafana](https://github.com/ExploreNYM/self-hosted-monitor/blob/main/grafana.sh) together with [Node Exporter](https://github.com/ExploreNYM/self-hosted-monitor/blob/main/node-exporter.sh) and [Nginx](https://github.com/ExploreNYM/self-hosted-monitor/blob/main/nginx-certbot.sh) to run their metrics monitoring stack locally.

In collaboration with ExploreNYM we published a [step by step guide](#setup) to set this up.

ExploreNYM also has a network measuring instance called `enym-monitor`. This setup is very simple for users, however it means that their data are all aggregated into one server such design always brings a risk of centralisation of distributed node's data into one computer.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Make sure you understand and properly evaluate what degree of control you give permission to before granting access to your data to any tools running on someone else's servers.
</Callout>

## Setup

**Minimum requirements of the monitor stack**

- 2 CPU
- 4 GB RAM
- 20 GB of free disk space.

SSH to your server as `root` or become one running `sudo -i` or `su`. If you prefer to administrate your VPS from a user environment, supply the commands with prefix `sudo`.

<Steps>

###### 1. The monitoring part setup

This can be setup on another VPS than the node if desired. We recommend to try to set this up on the same VPS, as your node as we expect the machine to be strong enough to handle the node with enough capacity reserve for monitor.

- Install git
```sh
apt install git
```

- Clone the repository to `~/self-hosted-monitor`
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ExploreNYM/self-hosted-monitor ~/self-hosted-monitor
```

- Give permissions to [`prometheus.sh`](https://github.com/ExploreNYM/self-hosted-monitor/blob/main/prometheus.sh) script and run it to setup Prometheus
```sh
chmod +x ~/self-hosted-monitor/prometheus.sh && ~/self-hosted-monitor/prometheus.sh
```

- Give permissions to [`grafana.sh`](https://github.com/ExploreNYM/self-hosted-monitor/blob/main/grafana.sh) script and run it to setup Grafana
```sh
chmod +x ~/self-hosted-monitor/grafana.sh && ~/self-hosted-monitor/grafana.sh
```

- Open port `3000` to allow access to Grafana
```sh
sudo ufw allow 3000
```

- You can now access Grafana at `http://<IP_ADDRESS>:3000`.

- *Optional step*: If you have a registered domain and prefer to use  it with `https`, give permissions to [`nginx-certbot.sh`](https://github.com/ExploreNYM/self-hosted-monitor/blob/main/nginx-certbot.sh) script and run it to setup Nginx and Certbot
```sh
chmod +x ~/self-hosted-monitor/nginx-certbot.sh && ~/self-hosted-monitor/nginx-certbot.sh
```

- Give permissions to [`prometheus-target.sh`](https://github.com/ExploreNYM/self-hosted-monitor/blob/main/prometheus-target.sh) script and run it to add a scrape target. This can be run multiple times to add a new server to be monitored via Prometheus/
```sh
chmod +x ~/self-hosted-monitor/prometheus-target.sh && ~/self-hosted-monitor/prometheus-target.sh
```

###### 2. The target server (the part to be monitored) setup

- In case you run this part on another VPS: Install git
```sh
apt install git
```

- In case you run this part on another VPS: Clone the repository to `~/self-hosted-monitor`
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ExploreNYM/self-hosted-monitor ~/self-hosted-monitor
```

- Give permissions to [`node-exporter.sh`](https://github.com/ExploreNYM/self-hosted-monitor/blob/main/node-exporter.sh) script and run it to setup Node exporter.
```sh
chmod +x ~/self-hosted-monitor/node-exporter.sh && ~/self-hosted-monitor/node-exporter.sh
```

###### 3. Grafana dashboard setup

Finally we need to access Grafana dashboards.

- Open a browser at `http://<IP_ADDRESS>:3000` or `https://<HOSTNAME>` (depends on your setup), enter username `admin` and password `admin` and setup new credentials on prompt

- Setup *Data source* by opening menu -> `Connections` -> `Data sources` -> `+ Add new data source` -> `Prometheus`

![](/images/operators/grafana/add-data-sources.png)
![](/images/operators/grafana/add-data-source-prometheus.png)

- In the field *Connection* next to `Prometheus server URL` enter `http://localhost:9090` (regardless if you accessing Grafana via `http` or `https` as this is for internal connection on the server). When you are done in the bottom confirm by `Save & Test`

- In the menu open: `Dashboards` -> `+ Create dashboard` -> `Import dashboard`

![](/images/operators/grafana/import-dashboard.png)

- ID field: enter `1860` -> `Load`

![](/images/operators/grafana/id-1860.png)

- In *Import dashboard* page select Prometheus in the bottom and finally `Import`

![](/images/operators/grafana/add-prometheus.png)

</Steps>

Now you have your Prometheus panels displayed via Grafana dashboard for a simple monitoring of your node.

## Verification and Troubleshooting

To ensure that your services are running correctly, you can verify that by running `systemctl status <SERVICE>` or run a `journalctl -f -u <SERVICE>` to print service logs. It shall return status `Active: active (running)`. For example:

- To check if Prometheus service is active:
```sh
systemctl status prometheus
```

- To check if Grafana service is active:
```sh
systemctl status grafana-server
```

- To check if node-exporter service is active:
```sh
systemctl status node_exporter
```

- To run journal log:
```sh
journalctl -f -u prometheus # or any other service you want to see
```
