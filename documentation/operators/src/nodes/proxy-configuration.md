# Reversed Proxy & Web Secure Socket

It's useful to put your Nym Node behind a reversed proxy and have it accessible via `https` domain, where you can host a [landing page](../legal/landing-pages.md). The guide is right [below](#reversed-proxy).

More advanced and secure solution is to have your node behind Web Secure Socket (WSS). Follow this [this guide](#web-secure-socket-setup) for installation.

```admonish info
For both of these configurations you will need to register a DNS domain and configure a record to your VPS.
```

## Variables Explanation

This guide contains several variables. Substitute them with your own value, without `<>` brackets. Here is a list of variables we used below.

| Variable              | Description                                                                                 | Syntax example                                            |
| :---                  | :---                                                                                        | :---                                                      |
| `<HOSTNAME>`          | Your registered DNS domain, asigned to the VPS with `nym-node`                              | exit-gateway1.squad.nsl                                   |
| `<WSS_PORT>`          | Port listening to WSS, default is `9001`                                                    | 9001                                                      |
| `<YOUR_WELCOME_TEXT>` | Any text you want to show on the landing page                                               | Welcome to Nym Node, operator contact is example@email.me |
| `<LANDING_PAGE_PATH>` | A sub-directory located at `/var/www/<HOSTNAME>` containing html configuration files        | `/var/www/exit-gateway1.squad.nsl`                        |
| `<NODE_ID>`           | A local only `nym-node` identifier, specified by flag `--id`, default is `default-nym-node` | alice_super_node                                          |
| `<PATH_TO>`           | Specify a full path to the given file, directory or binary behind this variable             | `/root/src/nym/target/release/`                                |

```admonish warning title=""
The commands in this setup need to be run with root permission. Either add a prefix `sudo` or execute them from a root shell.
```

## Reversed Proxy Setup

```admonish info
This guide was created by a Nym node operator, [Avril 14th](https://avril14th.org) as a part of [Nym Operators Community Counsel](../legal/community-counsel.md), edited by Nym.
```

The following snippet needs  be modified as described below according to the public identity that you may want to show on this public notice, i.e. your graphics and your email.
It would allow you to serve it as a landing page resembling the one proposed by [Tor](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/raw/HEAD/contrib/operator-tools/tor-exit-notice.html) but with all the changes needed to adhere to the Nym's operators case.



### HTML File Customization

File for html configuration are by convention located at `/var/www/<HOSTNAME>` directory and it's subdirectories. We refer to this directory as `<LANDING_PAGE_PATH>`.

1. Start by creating this directory:
```sh
mkdir -p /var/www/<HOSTNAME>
```

2. Use your own html code or copy the template below to a new file called `index.html` located in `/var/www/<HOSTNAME>` directory.

You are most likely accessing this website because you've had some issue with
the traffic coming from this IP. This router is part of the <a
href="https://nymtech.net/">NYM project</a>, which is
dedicated to <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/mission">create</a> outstanding
privacy software that is legally compliant without sacrificing integrity or
having any backdoors.
This router IP should be generating no other traffic, unless it has been
compromised.</p>

<p>
The Nym mixnet is operated by a decentralised community of node operators
and stakers. The Nym mixnet is trustless, meaning that no parts of the system
nor its operators have access to information that might compromise the privacy
of users. Nym software enacts a strict principle of data minimisation and has
no back doors. The Nym mixnet works by encrypting packets in several layers
and relaying those through a multi-layered network called a mixnet,  eventually
letting the traffic exit the Nym mixnet through an exit gateway like this one.
This design makes it very hard for a service to know which user is connecting to it,
since it can only see the IP-address of the Nym exit gateway:</p>

Then the last Nym node in the chain connects to the target service over the normal internet.</desc>

<a href="https://nymtech.net/about/mixnet">Read more about how Nym works.</a></p>

<p>
Nym relies on a growing ecosystem of users, developers and researcher partners
aligned with the mission to make sure Nym software is running, remains usable
and solves real problems. While Nym is not designed for malicious computer
users, it is true that they can use the network for malicious ends. This
is largely because criminals and hackers have significantly better access to
privacy and anonymity than do the regular users whom they prey upon. Criminals
can and do build, sell, and trade far larger and more powerful networks than
Nym on a daily basis. Thus, in the mind of this operator, the social need for
easily accessible censorship-resistant private, anonymous communication trumps
the risk of unskilled bad actors, who are almost always more easily uncovered
by traditional police work than by extensive monitoring and surveillance anyway.</p>

<p>
In terms of applicable law, the best way to understand Nym is to consider it a
network of routers operating as common carriers, much like the Internet
backbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, Nym mixnodes do not
contain identifiable routing information about the source of a packet and do
mix the user internet traffic with that of other users, making communications
private and protecting not just the user content but the metadata
(user's IP address, who the user talks to, when, where, from what device and
more) and no single Nym node can determine both the origin and destination
of a given transmission.</p>

<p>
As such, there is little the operator of this Exit Gateway can do to help you
track the connection further. This Exit Gateway maintains no logs of any of the
Nym mixnet traffic, so there is little that can be done to trace either legitimate or
illegitimate traffic (or to filter one from the other).  Attempts to
seize this router will accomplish nothing.</p>

<!-- FIXME: US-Only section. Remove if you are a non-US operator -->
<!--
<p>
Furthermore, this machine also serves as a carrier of email, which means that
its contents are further protected under the ECPA. <a
href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2707">18
USC 2707</a> explicitly allows for civil remedies ($1000/account
<i>plus</i>  legal fees)
in the event of a seizure executed without good faith or probable cause (it
should be clear at this point that traffic with an originating IP address of
FIXME_DNS_NAME should not constitute probable cause to seize the
machine). Similar considerations exist for 1st amendment content on this
machine.</p>
-->
<!-- FIXME: May or may not be US-only. Some non-US tor nodes have in
     fact reported DMCA harassment... -->
<!--
<p>
If you are a representative of a company who feels that this router is being
used to violate the DMCA, please be aware that this machine does not host or
contain any illegal content. Also be aware that network infrastructure
maintainers are not liable for the type of content that passes over their
equipment, in accordance with <a
href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512">DMCA
"safe harbor" provisions</a>. In other words, you will have just as much luck
sending a takedown notice to the Internet backbone providers.
</p>
-->

<p>To decentralise and enable privacy for a broad range of services, this
Exit Gateway adopts an <a href="https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/exit-policy.txt">Exit Policy</a>
in accordance with the <a href="https://tornull.org/">Tor Null ‘deny’ list</a>
and the <a href="https://tornull.org/tor-reduced-reduced-exit-policy.php">Tor reduced policy</a>,
which are two established safeguards.
</p>

<p>
That being said, if you still have a complaint about the router, you may email the
 <a href="mailto:>YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>">maintainer</a>. If complaints are related
 to a particular service that is being abused, the maintainer will submit that to the
 NYM Operators Community in order to add it to the Exit Policy cited above.
If approved, that would prevent this router from allowing that traffic to exit through it.
That can be done only on an IP+destination port basis, however. Common P2P ports are already blocked.</p>

You also have the option of blocking this IP address and others on the Nym network if you so desire.
 The Nym project provides a <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/gateways">
 web service</a> to fetch a list of all IP addresses of Nym Gateway Exit nodes that allow exiting to a
specified IP:port combination. Please be considerate when using these options.</p>

3. Before you save and close the file, make sure to edit the text, especially the information in these points:

- Add your favicon logo on the line:
```
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="">
```

- Add your header logo on the line:
```
<img class="logo" src="<FIXME>">
```

- By either setting the URl to the image (if you're hosting it publicly, i.e. on your web server)
```
href="<PATH_TO_YOUR_PUBLIC_URL>"

# and

src="<PATH_TO_YOUR_PUBLIC_URL>"
```

- **or** by adding the image inline as base64 encoded image
```
href="href="data:image/x-icon;base64,AAABAAMA....""

# and

src="href="data:image/x-icon;base64,AAABAAMA....""
```

- Add the email address you're willing to use for being contacted.
```
<a href="mailto:>YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>">maintainer</a>
```

- If you're running the node within the US check the sections marked as `FIXME`, add your DNS name and un-comment those.

4. Save and exit

Now your html page is configured.

### `nym-node` Configuration

When done with the customization, you'll need to make sure your `nym-node` uploads the file and reference to it. This is done by opening your node configuration file located at `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<NODE_ID>/config/config.toml` and changing the value of the line `landing_page_assets_path` on the `[http]` section:
```
landing_page_assets_path = '<LANDING_PAGE_PATH>'
```

### Reverse Proxy Configuration

You may set up a [reverse proxy](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/) in order to serve this landing page with proper SSL and DNS management, i.e. to resolve it to https://<HOSTNAME>.

The following assumes that you're owning a domain and that you've already set the Let's Encrypt certificates on your hosting, and you've copied those on your Gateway, i.e. copy the two Let's Encript pem files on your Gateway's home folder.
Else you may obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate using a [`--certonly` procedure](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#getting-certificates-and-choosing-plugins).

**Configure Nginx**

1. Install `nginx`:
```sh
sudo apt install nginx
```

2. Setup firewall with `ufw`. `ufw` has three profile pre-configured for `nginx`, we will need the first one for `nym-node`:

- `Nginx Full`: This profile opens both port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic) and port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)
- `Nginx HTTP`: This profile opens only port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic)
- `Nginx HTTPS`: This profile opens only port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)

```sh
ufw allow 'Nginx Full'

# you can verify by
ufw status

# possibly reload ufw by
ufw reload
```

3. Disable the default Nginx landing page
```
systemctl status nginx
unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
systemctl restart nginx
```

4. Add your endpoint configuration to Nginx by creating file:


```sh
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/<HOSTNAME>
```
- and changing `<HOSTNAME>` occurrences below with your domain name:

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

    server_name nym-exit.<HOSTNAME>;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<HOSTNAME>/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<HOSTNAME>/privkey.pem;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

  location / {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    if ($host = <HOSTNAME>) {
      return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
  }

    server_name <HOSTNAME> www.<HOSTNAME>;

    return 301 https://<HOSTNAME>$request_uri;
}
```


5. Activate the configuration by creating a simlink to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`:
```sh
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<HOSTNAME> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

6. Test your configuration syntax:
```sh
nginx -t
```

7. Restart `nginx`:
```sh
systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart nginx
```

8. Get an `SSL` certificate using certbot:

```sh
apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
certbot renew --dry-run
certbot --nginx -d <HOSTNAME>
```

9. Restart your `nym-node` or if you're running your `nym-node` as a [`systemd` service](configuration.md#systemd), restart your service:
```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
service nym-node restart
```

10. Check for the page being served reading the service logs
```sh
journalctl -u  nym-gateway.service | grep 8080

# where you should see
... Started NymNodeHTTPServer on 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Now your `nginx` should be configured, up and running. Test it by inserting your `<HOSTNAME>` as a URL in a browser.


## Web Secure Socket Setup

For better security of transfered data, we recommend node operators to run their nodes through Secure Socket instead of be out in open. You can read more about *Secure Socket Layer* (SSL) in [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secure-socket-layer-ssl/).

Before you start, don't forget to register a DNS and configure a record for your VPS with `nym-node`.


If you haven't configure reversed proxy before, start with [*Preliminary steps* chapter](#preliminary-steps) below and only then move to WSS setup. If you have reversed proxy already running and your `nym-node` can be reached via https, you can skip *Preliminary steps* and begin to setup WSS directly. Remember that there may be some unique variables and customization depending on the way your reversed proxy is done which you may have to adjust when installing WSS in order to make it work.

```admonish tip
To see description of used variables (noted in `<>` brackets), scroll to the top of this page, chapter [*Variables Explanation*](#variables-explanation).
```

We documented two options for node operators to setup WSS for `nym-node`:

1. [Using a script](#using-a-script)
2. [Step by step](#step-by-step)


### Preliminary Steps

Whether you choose to setup WSS manually or using the script, the preliminary steps are mandatory to begin with before you continue with the installation.

#### Firewall configuration

Make sure to open all [needed ports](vps-setup.md#configure-your-firewall), adding your `<WSS_PORT>`:

```sh
ufw allow <WSS_PORT>/tcp

# for example
# ufw allow 9001/tcp
```

#### Landing page configuration

1. Create server block directory for your https site:
```sh
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/<HOSTNAME>
```

2. Assign ownership using `$USER` environmental variable:
```sh
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/<HOSTNAME>
```

3. Create a landing page in `/var/www/<HOSTNAME>`. Either configure your own page (basic [syntax example](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introduction-to-html-basics/) or use our [template](#html-file-customization). Alternatively you can just make a simple welcome text using this command:
```sh
echo "<h1><YOUR_WELCOME_TEXT></h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/<HOSTNAME>/index.html
```

4. When done with the customization, you'll need to make sure your `nym-node` uploads the file and reference to it. This is done by opening your node configuration file located at `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<NODE_ID>/config/config.toml` and changing the value of the line `landing_page_assets_path` on the `[http]` section:
```sh
landing_page_assets_path = '<LANDING_PAGE_PATH>'

# for example
# landing_page_assets_path = '/var/www/exit-gateway1.squad.nsl'
```

Now you are ready to set up WSS, ether using a [script](#using-a-script) or [step-by-step](#step-by-step) tutorial.

### Using a Script

Using a script is a more convenient option but it takes away some customization possibilities. If you like to have your setup fully in your hands, use [*Step by step guide*](#step-by-step-guide). Before you move on, make sure you went through [*Preliminary steps*](#preliminary-steps).

1. Create a script by copying the block below and save it on your VPS as `wss_nginx_setup.sh`.

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="Script `wss_nginx_setup.sh`"
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "usage: sudo ./wss_nginx_setup.sh <host_name> <port_to_run_wss>"
    exit 1
fi

host_name=$1
port_value=$2

# preliminary checks
config_file_path="${HOME}/.nym/nym-nodes/*/config/config.toml"

# check if the configuration file exists
if [ ! -f $config_file_path ]; then
    echo "configuration file not found at $config_file_path"
    exit 1
fi

# extract hostname and wss port
hostname=$(grep "hostname" $config_file_path | awk -F" = " '{print $2}' | tr -d "'")
wss_port=$(grep "announce_wss_port" $config_file_path | awk -F" = " '{print $2}' | tr -d ' ')

# check if hostname is empty
if [ -z "$hostname" ]; then
    echo "hostname is empty, updating it to ${host_name}"
    sed -i "s|hostname = ''|hostname = '${host_name}'|" $config_file_path
else
    echo "current hostname: $hostname"
fi

# check if wss port is set to 0 and update it
if [ "$wss_port" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "wss port is 0, updating it to ${port_value}"
    sed -i "s/announce_wss_port *= *0/announce_wss_port = ${port_value}/" $config_file_path
else
    echo "current wss port: $wss_port"
fi

2. Make the script executable:
```sh
chmod u+x wss_nginx_setup.sh
```

3. Run the script as root (with `sudo` or from the root shell):
```sh
./wss_nginx_setup.sh <HOSTNAME> <WSS_PORT>
# hostname is your domain
# wss default port is 9001
```


4. Restart your `nym-node` or if you're running your `nym-node` as a [`systemd` service](configuration.md#systemd), restart your service:
```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
service nym-node restart
```

Your `nym-node` should be configured to run over WSS now. Test it using the steps in the chapter [below](#test-wss-setup)


### Step by Step Guide

Step by step guide is more advanced than using a [script](#using-a-script), but it allows for more customisation. Before you move on, make sure you finished [*Preliminary steps*](#preliminary-steps*).


#### Nginx Configuration


1. Install `nginx`:
```sh
apt install nginx
```

2. Setup firewall with `ufw`. `ufw` has three profile pre-configured for `nginx`, we will need the first one for `nym-node`:

- `Nginx Full`: This profile opens both port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic) and port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)
- `Nginx HTTP`: This profile opens only port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic)
- `Nginx HTTPS`: This profile opens only port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)

```sh
ufw allow 'Nginx Full'

# you can verify by
ufw status
```

#### WSS & Landing page configuration

We made the landing page customization directory in [*Preliminary steps*](#preliminary-steps), next steps will configure that with Nginx.

3. Configure your site to work with `nginx`. Open a new text file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/<HOSTNAME>` and paste the block below. Don't forget to insert your correct values.
~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="Site configuration `/etc/nginx/sites-available/<HOSTNAME>`"
```bash
#####################################################
# EXCHANGE ALL <HOSTNAME> & <WSS_PORT> VARIABLES ! #

      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  }
}


# http configuration

    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
  }

    server_name <HOSTNAME> www.<HOSTNAME>;

    return 301 https://<HOSTNAME>$request_uri;
}


# WSS configuration
server {
    listen <WSS_PORT> ssl http2;
    listen [::]:<WSS_PORT> ssl http2;

    server_name <HOSTNAME>;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<HOSTNAME>/fullchain.pem;

        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;

        proxy_pass http://localhost:9000;
        proxy_intercept_errors on; # Enable intercepting errors from the proxy
    }

}
```
~~~

4. Activate the configuration by creating a simlink to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`:
```sh
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<HOSTNAME> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

5. Test your configuration syntax:
```sh
nginx -t
```

6. Restart `nginx`:
```sh
systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart nginx
```

#### SSL Setup using certbot

7. Get an `SSL` certificate using certbot:

```sh
apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
certbot renew --dry-run
certbot --nginx -d <HOSTNAME>
```

8. Restart your `nym-node` or if you're running your `nym-node` as a [`systemd` service](configuration.md#systemd), restart your service:
```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
service nym-node restart
```

Your `nym-node` should be configured to run over WSS now. Test it using the steps in the chapter [below](#test-wss-setup).

### Test WSS Setup

You can do a few quick checks to test that your installation worked out and your `nym-node` is running correctly using WSS:

- Check out connection with `wscat` from another (local) machine:
```sh
# install
sudo apt install node-ws

# run
wscat -c ws://<HOSTNAME>:<WSS_PORT>
```

- Browse your `<HOSTNAME>` as URL and see your landing page.

- Check Swagger API of your node using the hostname: `https://<HOSTNAME>/api/v1/swagger/#/`
