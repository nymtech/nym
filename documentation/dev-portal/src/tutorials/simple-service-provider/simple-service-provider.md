# Building a Simple Service Provider

```admonish warning
This tutorial was written before the creation of the [Typescript SDK](https://sdk.nymtech.net), and involves running a Nym Client alongside your application processes, instead of relying on the SDK to integrate the Client process into your application logic.  

As such, although this tutorial is still a valid way of approaching building on Nym, it is a little less streamlined than it could be.

A more streamlined rewrite of this tutorial will be coming soon. 
```
This tutorial is the best place to start for developers new to Nym. You will learn how to build a minimum viable privacy-enabled application (PEApp) able to send and receive traffic via the mixnet.

This tutorial is less about building an immediately useful application, and more about beginning to understand:
* Sending messages through the mixnet to another Nym client  
* Receiving messages from the mixnet and handling them 
* Anonymous replies with Single Use Reply Blocks (SURBs)

That said, this tutorial will give you the skeleton of an application, onto which you can add more useful functionality.
