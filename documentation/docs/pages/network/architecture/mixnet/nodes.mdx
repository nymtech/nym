# Mixnet Nodes

> The node setup and maintenance guides can be found in the [Operator Guides book]() TODO LINK

Although a large proportion of the Nym mixnet's functionality is implemented client-side, several key anonymity features rely on the decentralised node network that make up the Mixnet.

As outlined on the previous page, the various types of Mixnet nodes - Mix Nodes, Gateways, and Network Requesters - are in the process of being compounded into a single `nym-node` binary which will run performing the features of all three nodes:
- Acting as the first and last hops for traffic moving through the mixnet - a role fulfilled currently by Gateways.
- (Once the payment system is turned on) checking client credentials to check for payment via the zk-nym TODO LINK protocol - a role fulfilled currently by Entry Gateways.
- Accepting incoming Sphinx packets from other Nym nodes and, using a variable delay, 'mixing' them with other packets (not forwarding on received packets according to FIFO but instead relying on a randomised delay function) - a role currently fulfilled by Mix Nodes.
- Forwarding packets on to their final destination: the 'receiving' Nym client.

Traffic moving through the mixnet will always move between a sending and receiving client, with 5 'hops' between them:
- Start. sender -> Ingress Gateway
- Hop 1. Ingress Gateway -> Mix Node 1
- Hops 2..4 Mix Node 1 -> Mix Node 2 -> Mix Node 3
- Hop 5. Mix Node 3 -> Exit Gateway
- Fin. Exit Gateway -> receiving client.

See the [traffic flow]() TODO LINK page for detailed information on how traffic moves through the Mixnet.
