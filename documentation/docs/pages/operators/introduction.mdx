# Introduction

This is **Nym's Operators guide**, containing information and setup guides for the various components of Nym network and Nyx blockchain validators.

Nym network (also known as mixnet) routes and mixes packets through Gateways and Mixnodes, all run from the same binary called `nym-node`.

```ascii
                      ┌─►mix──┐  mix     mix
                      │       │
            Entry     │       │                   Exit
client ───► Gateway ──┘  mix  │  mix  ┌─►mix ───► Gateway ───► internet
                              │       │
                              │       │
                         mix  └─►mix──┘  mix
```
