// 2. DealingExchange -> the actual (off-chain) dealing exchange is happening
// 3. ComplaintSubmission -> receivers submitting evidence of other dealers sending malformed data
// 4. ComplaintVoting -> (if any complaints were submitted) receivers voting on the validity of the evidence provided
// 5. VerificationKeySubmission -> receivers submitting their partial (and master) verification keys
// 6. VerificationKeyMismatchSubmission -> receivers / watchers raising issue that the submitted VK are mismatched with their local derivations
// 7. VerificationKeyMismatchVoting -> (if any complaints were submitted) receivers voting on received mismatches
// 8. InProgress -> all receivers have all their secrets derived and all is good
//
// Note: It's important that the variant ordering is not changed otherwise it would mess up the derived `PartialOrd`
