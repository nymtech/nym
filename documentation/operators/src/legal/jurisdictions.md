The following part is for informational purposes only. Nym core team cannot provide comprehensive legal advice across all jurisdictions. Knowledge and experience with the legalities are being built up with the help of our counsel and with you, the community of Nym node operators. We encourage Nym node operators to join the [Node Operator](https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat) and [Operators Legal Forum](https://matrix.to/#/!YfoUFsJjsXbWmijbPG:nymtech.chat?via=nymtech.chat&via=matrix.org) channels on Element to share best practices and experiences.

There is no one silver bullet covering the entire globe. Every jurisdiction has different set of laws and practices regarding internet traffic routing. Therefore the Node Operators Legal Forum pages are divided per region.

These are some findings from our legal team as an example:

- [Switzerland](swiss.md)
- [United States](united-states.md)

> Nym Node operators are invited to add their legal findings directly through [pull requests](add-content.md).
