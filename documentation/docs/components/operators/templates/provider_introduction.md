Hi, 

I am reaching out to introduce myself! I am about to spin up a machine with you to run what is called a “nym node” - think of it as somewhat similar to a Tor exit node. 

You can always recognize a nym node by our domain names: nym-exit

Nym node runners are a decentralized community all over the world. We provide secure internet traffic routing services to ordinary people and businesses via the Nym platform and NymVPN app. 

The traffic pattern is somewhat unique, as we route traffic using the “sphinx” packet format (again, think onion routing), which makes all traffic look uniform. I wanted to introduce myself and the machines I am running just so that this unique traffic pattern doesn’t raise any flags or issues with you! 

We have the highest security standards, which also means I simply relay traffic and do not know the end-destination nor its content. More information can be found at https://nym.com.

Feel free to ask any questions. 

Many thanks, 

<YOUR_NAME/PSEUDONYM>
