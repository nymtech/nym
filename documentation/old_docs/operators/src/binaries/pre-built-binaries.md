# Pre-built Binaries

The [Github releases page](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases) has pre-built binaries which should work on Ubuntu 20.04 and other Debian-based systems, but at this stage cannot be guaranteed to work everywhere.

If the pre-built binaries don't work or are unavailable for your system, you will need to build the platform yourself.
