# The `console_error_panic_hook` crate provides better debugging of panics by
# logging them with `console.error`. This is great for development, but requires
# all the `std::fmt` and `std::panicking` infrastructure, so isn't great for
# code size when deploying.

# `wee_alloc` is a tiny allocator for wasm that is only ~1K in code size
# compared to the default allocator's ~10K. It is slower than the default
# allocator, however.
#
# Unfortunately, `wee_alloc` requires nightly Rust when targeting wasm for now.

# This gets ignored right now, and there is a compiler warning generated:
# "warning: profiles for the non root package will be ignored, specify profiles 
# at the workspace root"
#
# I'm OK with that for the moment, I don't want to put it in the root Cargo file
# as I'm unclear what effect it'll have and I'm still experimenting with wasm. 
# But it's good that we are reminded to do something about it before any 
# production release.
