# Nym Node


NYM NODE is a tool for running a node within the Nym network. Nym Nodes containing functionality such as `mixnode`, `entry-gateway` and `exit-gateway` are fundamental components of Nym Mixnet architecture. Nym Nodes are ran by decentralised node operators.

To setup any type of Nym Node, start with either building [Nym's platform](../binaries/building-nym.mdx) from source or download [pre-compiled binaries](../binaries/pre-built-binaries.mdx) on the [configured server (VPS)](preliminary-steps/vps-setup.mdx) where you want to run the node. Your Nym Node will need to be bonded before it can be run. We recommend most users use the [Nym desktop wallet](preliminary-steps/wallet-preparation.mdx) for this.

**Read thoroughly [Minimum Requirement page](../nodes.mdx) before you configure and run a `nym-node`!**
