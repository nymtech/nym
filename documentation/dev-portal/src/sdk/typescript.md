# Typescript SDK
The Typescript SDK allows developers to start building browser-based mixnet applications quickly, by simply importing the SDK into their code via NPM as they would any other Typescript library.

If you'd like to learn more, build apps or integrate Nym components using the TS SDK, visit the dedicated [TS SDK Handbook](https://sdk.nymtech.net/).
