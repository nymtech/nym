# Nym Node Setup & Run

This documentation page provides a guide on how to set up and run a [NYM NODE](nym-node.md), along with explanations of available flags, commands, and examples.

## Current version

```
<!-- cmdrun ../../../../target/release/nym-node --version -->
```

```admonish info
**Migrating an existing node to a new `nym-node` is simple. The steps are documented [below](#migrate).**
```

```admonish note
If you are a `nym-mixnode` or `nym-gateway` operator and you are not familiar wwith the binary changes called *Project Smoosh*, you can read the archived [Smoosh FAQ](../archive/smoosh-faq.md) page.
```

## Summary

> Any syntax in `<>` brackets is a user's unique variable. Exchange with a corresponding name without the `<>` brackets.

To run a new node, you can simply execute the `nym-node` command without any flags. By default, the node will set necessary configurations. If you later decide to change a setting, you can use the `-w` flag.

The most crucial aspect of running the node is specifying the `--mode`, which can be one of three: `mixnode`, `entry-gateway`, and `exit-gateway`.

Currently `nym-node` binary enables to run only one `--mode` at a time. In the future the operators will be able to specify multiple modes within one `nym-node`. Our goal is to have as many nodes each running all the available modes enabled and let the Nym API to position the node acoording the network needs in the beginning of each epoch.

Every `exit-gateway` mode is basically an `entry-gateway` with NR (Network Requester) and IPR (IP Packet Router) enabled. This means that every `exit-gateway` is automatically seen as an `entry-gateway` but not the opposite.

Gateway operators can check out the performance, connectivity and much more in our new tool [harbourmaster.nymtech.net](https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/).

To determine which mode your node is running, you can check the `:8080/api/v1/roles` endpoint. For example:
```
# for http
http://<IP_ADDRESS>:8080/api/v1/roles

# for https reversed proxy
https://<DOMAIN>/api/v1/roles
```

Everything necessary will exist on your node by default. For instance, if you're running a mixnode, you'll find that a NR (Network Requester) and IPR (IP Packet Router) address exist, but they will be ignored in `mixnode` mode.

For more information about available endpoints and their status, you can refer to:
```
# for http
http://<IP>:8080/api/v1/swagger/#/

# for https reversed proxy
https://<DOMAIN>/api/v1/swagger/#/
```

## Usage

### Help Command

There are a few changes from the individual binaries used in the past. For example by default `run` command does `init` function as well, local node `--id` will be set by default unless specified otherwise etcetera.

Run `./nym-node --help` to see all available commands:

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="`./nym-node --help` output:"
```
<!-- cmdrun ../../../../target/release/nym-node --help -->
```
~~~

To list all available flags for each command, run `./nym-node <COMMAND> --help` for example `./nym-node run --help`:

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="`./nym-node run --help` output:"
```
<!-- cmdrun ../../../../target/release/nym-node run --help  -->
```
~~~

The Wireguard flags currently have limited functionality, with `--wireguard-enabled` being the most relevant, enabling or disabling wireguard functionality.

#### Flags Summary

Some of the most useful flags and their explanation:

- `--id <YOUR_ID>`: Local identifier of your node. This `<ID>` determines your config path located at `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/config/config.toml`, default value is `default-nym-node`
- `--config-file <PATH>`: Used for the migrate command to indicate the location of the existing node config file. Default path is `~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/config/config.toml`
- `--deny-init`: Use this flag to prevent a new node from being initialized. It's recommended to use this after the first run to avoid accidental spinning up of a second node.
- `--init-only`: Use this flag if you want to set up a node without starting it.
- `--mode`: Determines the mode of the node and is always required.
- `--write-changes`: Used to change values within the `config.toml` file after the node has been run.
- `--mnemonic`: This is for when gateways are coconut-credentials-enforced, and this mnemonic is used as the `double_spend` prevention. This account needs credit in order for it to work.
- `--expose-system-info <true/false>`: Sets your system info visibility on the network.
- `--expose-system-hardware <true/false>`: Sets your system hardware info visibility on the network.
- `--expose-crypto-hardware <true/false>`: Sets your crypto hardware info visibility on the network.


## Commands & Examples

**`nym-node` introduces a default human readible ID (local only) `default-nym-node`, which is used if there is not an explicit custom `--id <ID>` specified. All configuration is stored in `~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/config/config.toml` or `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/config/config.toml` erespectively.**

### Initialise & Run

When we use `run` command the node will do `init` as well, unless we specify with a flag `--deny-init`. Below are some examples of initialising and running `nym-node` with different modes (`--mode`) like `mixnode`, `entry-gateway`, `exit-gateway`.

```admonish note
To prevent over-flooding of our documentation we cannot provide with every single command syntax as there is a large combination of possibilities. Please use a common sense and the explanation in `--help` option.
```

#### Mode: `exit-gateway`

As part of the transition, `allowed.list` on Exit Gateway embedded Network Requester was depreciated.

**Initialise and run:**
```sh
# simple default
./nym-node  run  --mode exit-gateway

# with other options
./nym-node run --id <ID> --mode exit-gateway --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)" --hostname "<YOUR_DOMAIN>" --http-bind-address 0.0.0.0:8080 --mixnet-bind-address 0.0.0.0:1789 true --wireguard-enabled true
```

Initialise only with a custom `--id` and `--init-only` command :

```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --init-only --mode exit-gateway --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)" --hostname "<YOUR_DOMAIN>" --http-bind-address 0.0.0.0:8080 --mixnet-bind-address 0.0.0.0:1789 true --wireguard-enabled true
```

Run the node with custom `--id` without initialising
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --deny-init --mode exit-gateway
```

#### Mode: `entry-gateway`

**Initialise and run:**
```sh
./nym-node run --mode entry-gateway
```

Initialise only with a custom `--id` and `--init-only` command:
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --init-only --mode entry-gateway --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)" --hostname "<YOUR_DOMAIN>" --http-bind-address 0.0.0.0:8080 --mixnet-bind-address 0.0.0.0:1789
```

Run the node with custom `--id` without initialising:
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --deny-init --mode entry-gateway
```

#### Mode: `mixnode`

**Initialise and run:**
```sh
./nym-node run --mode mixnode
```

Initialise only with a custom `--id` and `--init-only` command:
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --init-only --mode mixnode --verloc-bind-address 0.0.0.0:1790 --public-ips "$(curl -4 https://ifconfig.me)"
```

Run the node with custom `--id` without initialising:
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --deny-init --mode mixnode
```

Run the node with custom `--id` without initialising:
```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --deny-init --mode entry-gateway
```

### Migrate

```admonish caution
Migration is a must for all deprecated nodes (`nym-mixnode`, `nym-gateway`). For backward compatibility we created an [archive section](../archive/setup-guides.md) with all the guides for individual binaries. However, the binaries from version 1.1.35 (`nym-gateway`) and 1.1.37 (`nym-mixnode`) onwards will no longer have `init` command.
```

To migrate a `nym-mixnode` or a `nym-gateway` to `nym-node` is fairly simple, use the `migrate` command with `--config-file` flag pointing to the original `config.toml` file, with a conditional argument defining which type of node this configuration belongs to. Examples are below.

#### Mode: `mixnode`
```sh
# move relevant infor from config.toml
./nym-node migrate --config-file ~/.nym/mixnodes/<MIXNODE_ID>/config/config.toml mixnode

# initialise with the new nym-node config
./nym-node run --mode mixnode --id <NYM-NODE_ID> --deny-init
```

#### Mode: `entry-gateway` and `exit-gateway`
```sh
# move relevant infor from config.toml
./nym-node migrate --config-file ~/.nym/gateways/<GATEWAY_ID>/config/config.toml gateway

# initialise with the new nym-node config
./nym-node run --mode exit-gateway --id <NYM-NODE_ID> --deny-init # or change to entry-gateway
```
