# Manual Node Upgrade

This page explains how to upgrade [`nym-node`](#nym-node-upgrade) or [`validator`](#validator-upgrade) to the latest version in a few steps. If you prefer to automate the process, try to setup your flow with [Nymvisor](nymvisor-upgrade.md).

<VarInfo />

## Nym node Upgrade

**Upgrading your node is a straight forward two-step process:**

<Steps>

#### 1. Updating the binary and `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/config/config.toml` on your VPS

#### 2. Updating the node information in the [mixnet smart contract](https://nymtech.net/docs/nyx/mixnet-contract.html). This is the information that is present on the [mixnet explorer](https://explorer.nymtech.net).

</Steps>

Below are detailed steps how to do it:

<Steps>

###### 1. Upgrading node binary and information in config file

- Pause your node process.
    - If you run your node as `systemd` service (recommended), run: `service nym-node stop`
    - Otherwise open the terminal window with your node logs and press `ctrl + c`

- Replace the existing `nym-node` binary with the newest binary (which you can either [compile yourself](../../binaries/building-nym.mdx) or [download](../../binaries/pre-built-binaries.mdx).

- [Re-run with the same values](../nym-node/setup.mdx#initialise--run) as you use to run your `nym-node`. If you want keep changes in your config file, use flag `-w` (`--write-changes`), **This will just update the config file, it will not overwrite existing keys**.
    - If you automated your node with `systemd` (recommended) run:
```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
service nym-node start
```

- If you want to monitor the logs of your `nym-node.service`, run:
```sh
journalctl -f -u nym-node.service
```

###### 2. Updating your node information in the smart contract

Follow these steps to update the information about your `nym-node` which is publicly available from the [`nym-api`](https://validator.nymtech.net/api/swagger/index.html) and information displayed on the [Mixnet explorer](https://explorer.nymtech.net).

You can either do this graphically via the Desktop Wallet, or the CLI.

## Validator Upgrade

Upgrading from `v0.31.1` -> `v0.32.0` process is fairly simple. Grab the `v0.32.0` release tarball from the [`nyxd` releases page](https://github.com/nymtech/nyxd/releases), and untar it. Inside are two files:

- The new validator (`nyxd`) v0.32.0
- The new `wasmvm` (it depends on your platform, but most common filename is `libwasmvm.x86_64.so`)

Wait for the upgrade height to be reached and the chain to halt awaiting upgrade, then:

- Coopy `libwasmvm.x86_64.so` to the default LD_LIBRARY_PATH on your system (on Ubuntu 20.04 this is `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`) replacing your existing file with the same name.
- Swap in your new `nyxd` binary and restart.

You can also use something like [Cosmovisor](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor) - grab the relevant information from the current upgrade proposal [here](https://nym.explorers.guru/proposal/9).

Cosmovisor will swap the `nyxd` binary, but you'll need to already have the `libwasmvm.x86_64.so` in place.

### Common Reasons Validator Being Jailed

The most common reason for your validator being jailed is that it runs out of memory because of bloated syslogs.

Running the command `df -H` will return the size of the various partitions of your VPS.

If the `/dev/sda` partition is almost full, try pruning some of the `.gz` syslog archives and restart your validator process.
