# Browser-Based Apps
Browsers are a restricted environment to work in, with limited options for external communications (websockets, Web Transport API, WebRTC), mixed content restrictions (HTTPS-only), and no access to the file system or any syscalls. But the main issue when trying to capture traffic and send it via a different transport - such as the Mixnet - is the lack of access to browser TLS negotiation from JS or CA certificate store.

This means that the functionality offered by our current browser-based solutions are quite restricted / specific. There are currently two options for interacting with the Mixnet from the browser: `mixFetch`, and the WASM SDK.

TODO MOD DIAGRAM BOTTOM PART TO INCLUDE NYM CLIENT IN REMOTE SERVICE

Both `mixFetch` and the WASM client are delivered to the client bundled into a web application.

## mixFetch
Drop-in replacement for browser's `fetch` API that makes HTTP requests from Exit Gateways using the SOCKS Network Requester.

Uses an embedded CA certificate store to establish TLS session between `mixFetch` and the remote host, creating an client-host secure channel from the browser to the host over the Mixnet.

Internally it uses the WASM client.

### Current Limitations of `mixFetch`
It cannot currently handle current requests, and comes with a pre-bundled CA store. `mixFetchv2` - which will act more like a general-purpose userspace IP stack - is currently in development.

## WASM Client
Makes Sphinx packets and cover traffic using WASM and sent over a Websocket to the Entry Gateway and receive responses.

This only works in messaging mode (i.e. messages sent either as text or binary data), and currently doesn’t support making IP packets that are routed to the Internet by an Exit Gateway IPR. If you want to send HTTP(S) requests, use `mixFetch`.

Limitations of CSPs and Mixed Content restrictions (i.e HTTPS only) apply to the Websocket connection as normal in browsers or embedded WebViews.

Runs in a web worker to leave UI thread free for the user.

## Security Considerations
TODO check if WASM / MF are using all features (SURBs, cover, etc)
