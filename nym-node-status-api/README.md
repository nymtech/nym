# Nym Node Status API
The Node Status API serves information about individual `nym-nodes` in the Mixnet, such as which role they are operating in, statistics about them, services such as Network Requesters, as well as summaries of the state of the Mixnet.

We recommend that developers building applications such as explorers or analytics interfaces about the Mixnet run their own instance of the API, in order to promote a robust network of downstream services, and spread the load of API calls amongst as many endpoints as possible.

You can find build and operation instructions in the [docs](https://nym.com/docs/apis/ns-api).
