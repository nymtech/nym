# Documentation

## Doc projects
Each directory contains a readme with more information about running and contributing to the projects. Each is built with [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) - use `mdbook serve` to build and serve them (defaults to `localhost:3000`).
* `docs` contains technical documentation hosted at [https://nymtech.net/docs](https://nymtech.net/docs)
* `dev-portal` contains developer documentation hosted at [https://nymtech.net/developers](https://nymtech.net/developers)
* `operators` contains node setup and maintenance guides hosted at [https://nymtech.net/operators](https://nymtech.net/operators)

> If you are looking for the Typescript SDK documentation located at [sdk.nymtech.net](https://sdk.nymtech.net) this can be found in `../sdk/typescript/docs/`

## Contribution 
* If you wish to add to the documentation please create a PR against this repo. 
* If you are **adding a plugin dependency** make sure to also **add that to the list of plugins in `install_mdbook_deps.sh` line 12**. 

## Scripts 
* `bump_versions.sh` allows you to update the ~~`platform_release_version` and~~ `wallet_release_version` variable~~s~~ in the `book.toml` of each mdbook project at once. You can also optionally update the `minimum_rust_version` as well. Helpful for lazy-updating when cutting a new version of the docs. 

* The following scripts are used by the `ci-dev.yml` and `cd-dev.yml` scripts:
  * `build_all_to_dist.sh` is used for building all mdbook projects and moving the rendered html to `../dist/` to be rsynced with various servers. 
  * `install_mdbook_deps.sh` checks for an existing install of mdbook (and plugins), uninstalls them, and then installs them on a clean slate. This is to avoid weird dependency clashes if relying on an existing mdbook version. 
  * `post_process.sh` is used to post process CSS/image/href links for serving several mdbooks from a subdirectory. 
  * `removed_existing_config.sh` is used to check for existing nym client/node config files on the CI/CD server and remove it if it exists. This is to mitigate issues with `mdbook-cmdrun` where e.g. a node is already initialised, and the command fails.
