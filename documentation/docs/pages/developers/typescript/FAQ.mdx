# TS SDK FAQ

## Why and when does the mixnet client complain about insufficient topology?

It will in one of the following cases:
- There are empty mix layers - although this is rare;
- The gateway you've registered with does not appear in the network topology -> it is either unbonded or was blacklisted;
- The gateway you want to send packets to does not appear in the network topology -> it is either unbonded or was blacklisted;

To avoid the last two, you need to make sure the gateway you are calling is bonded and whitelisted.

## How can I check whether the gateway I am connecting to is bonded and not blacklisted?

The easiest way of checking what gateway you're registered with is to look at your client address.
Client addresses are in the format of:
`client-id . client-dh @ gateway-id. `

To illustrate this: `DpB3cHAchJiNBQi5FrZx2csXb1mrHkpYh9Wzf8Rjsuko.ANNWrvHqMYuertHGHUrZdBntQhpzfbWekB39qez9U2Vx@2BuMSfMW3zpeAjKXyKLhmY4QW1DXurrtSPEJ6CjX3SEh `

- `DpB3cHAchJiNBQi5FrZx2csXb1mrHkpYh9Wzf8Rjsuko`: is the client's identity key;
- `ANNWrvHqMYuertHGHUrZdBntQhpzfbWekB39qez9U2Vx`: is the client's Diffie Hellman key;
- `2BuMSfMW3zpeAjKXyKLhmY4QW1DXurrtSPEJ6CjX3SEh`: is the gateway's identity, which is what you'll need to check the state of the gateway in the [Nym Explorer](https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/gateways).
