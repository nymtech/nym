# Essential Parameters & Variables

Our documentation often refer to syntax annotated in `<>` brackets. We use this expression for variables that are unique to each user (like path, local moniker, versions etcetra). Any syntax in `<>` brackets needs to be substituted with your correct name or version, without the `<>` brackets.

Below is a table listing the most essential variables and parameters which they may come along with, together with description and syntax example.  It should help operators and developers to familiarise themselves with the convention of parameters and variables we use across the documentation.


<Callout>
To prevent over-flooding of our documentation we cannot provide with every single command syntax as there is a large combination of possibilities. Remember that you can always print the options using a `--help` flag together with any binary command.
