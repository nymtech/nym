**For all routing configuration we provide one tool [`network-tunnel-manager.sh` (NTM)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nymtech/nym/refs/heads/develop/scripts/wireguard-exit-policy/wireguard-exit-policy-manager.sh). This tool manages WireGuard tests all configurations, including WireGuard exit policy as well.**


You can use NTM to validate the application of the IP tables routes on your `nym-node` by checking it from the server side as well as from the outside.

    <div>
      <Tabs items={[
        <strong>From the server</strong>,
        <strong>From the outside - using NymVPN</strong>
      ]} defaultIndex={0}>
        <Tabs.Tab><ExitPolicyTestServer /></Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab><ExitPolicyTestOutside /></Tabs.Tab>
      </Tabs>
    </div>


If all works , your node has successfully implemented WireGuard exit policy with the same routing permissions like [Nym exit policy](https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/exit-policy.txt) used on 5-hop (Mixnet) for TCP routing.
