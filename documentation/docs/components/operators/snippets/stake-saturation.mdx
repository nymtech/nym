Stake saturation is a node reputation done in a form of self bond or stakers delegation. Optimal stake saturation level is calculated as:

<Callout type="info" borderColor="#008080" backgroundColor="#20b2aa" emoji="ðŸ“Œ">
> **stake_saturation_level = staking_target / rewarded_set_size**
>
> **rewarded_set_size = active_set_size + standby_set_size**
</Callout>

With current circulating supply of <span style={{display: 'inline-block'}}><CirculatingSupply /></span> NYM, staking target of <span style={{display: 'inline-block'}}><StakingTarget /></span> NYM, divided by the sum of nodes in the [rewarded set](https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/epoch/reward_params), <b>the stake saturation level is <span style={{display: 'inline-block'}}><StakeSaturation /></span> NYM per node.</b> 

Node stake saturation is a value between `0` and `1` following this logic.

**Node stake saturation formula:**

<Callout type="info" borderColor="#008080" backgroundColor="#20b2aa" emoji="ðŸ“Œ">
> **node_stake_saturation = node_total_stake / stake_saturation_level**
</Callout>



- If a node has sum of self bond and delegations (stake) equal to the stake saturation level, then its `stake_saturation = 1`. 

- In case of a smaller

imagine the rewards for a fully saturated node are 250, with each staked token being rewarded (example) 0.01 NYM. Now imagine saturation is 200%: the reward for the node is still 250, but the APY for staked tokens is actually half, ie, 0.005 NYM
saturation maxes out at 1.0
if you have 1.3 instead of 1.0, you get the same rewards
so all those additional staked tokens are wasted
