cpucycles-info - report information about CPU cycle counters
.SS SYNOPSIS

.nf
\f[C]
cpucycles-info
\f[R]
.fi
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[V]cpucycles-info\f[R] prints human-readable information about the
cycle counters considered by \f[V]cpucycles()\f[R].
.PP
The format is subject to change but currently includes a
\f[V]cpucycles version\f[R] line, \f[V]cpucycles tracesetup\f[R] lines
showing which cycle counters are considered and how precise they seem to
be (with smaller \f[V]precision\f[R] values being better, except that
\f[V]precision 0\f[R] means a cycle counter that does not seem to work),
a \f[V]cpucycles persecond\f[R] line about the selected cycle counter, a
\f[V]cpucycles implementation\f[R] line about the selected cycle
counter, and \f[V]cpucycles observed persecond\f[R] lines about the
selected cycle counter.
