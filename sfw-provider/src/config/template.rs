# Completely optional value specifying geographical location of this particular node.

# to verify correctness of the information provided. However, feel free to fill in
# this field with as much accuracy as you wish to share.

##### Mixnet endpoint config options #####

# Optional address announced to the directory server for the clients to connect to.

# later on by using name resolvable with a DNS query, such as `nymtech.net:8080`.
# Additionally a custom port can be provided, so both `nymtech.net:8080` and `nymtech.net`
# are valid announce addresses, while the later will default to whatever port is used for
# `listening_address`.
