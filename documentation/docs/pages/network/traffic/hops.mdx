# Traffic Hops
As highlighted in the previous page, Sphinx packets are sent between multiple nodes. Each time a packet is sent between node, it is referred to as a 'hop'. When a Mix Node receives an incoming packet, it decrypts the outer layer of the packet and applies a variable length timing delay before sending the packet out on the next hop. Gateways do not apply this delay.
