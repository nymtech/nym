# Validators Troubleshooting

### Common reasons for your validator being jailed

The most common reason for your validator being jailed is that your validator is out of memory because of bloated syslogs.

- Running the command `df -H` will return the size of the various partitions of your VPS.

- If the `/dev/sda` partition is almost full, try pruning some of the `.gz` syslog archives and restart your validator process.

- You can [check out if your `syslog`s](vps-isp.mdx#pruning-logs) aren't eating all your disk space and prune them.
