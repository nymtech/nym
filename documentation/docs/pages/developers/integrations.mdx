# Integrations

There are several options available to developers wanting to embed a Nym client in their application code.

<Tabs items={['Typescript/Javascript', 'Rust/Go/C++', 'Other']}>
  <Tabs.Tab > See the [Typescript/Javascript](./integrations/ts-js) page. </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab> See the [Rust/Go/C++](./integrations/rust-go-cpp) page. </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab> If your app is not written in any of the supported languages, you might still be able to send traffic through a standalone socks5 client TODO LINK but will have to think about packaging and bundling the client binary with e.g. a `systemd` file for autostart to run the client as a daemon. If you want to discuss FFI options reach out to us via our public dev channel. </Tabs.Tab>
