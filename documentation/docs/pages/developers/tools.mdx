# Tools

There are a few tools available to developers for chain interaction: the `nym-cli` tool, which operates as an easier-to-use wrapper around `nyxd`, to allow operators to script interactions with their infrastructure (and those who prefer CLI tools ;) ).

There is also a basic echo server tool which app developers can use as a quick endpoint for traffic testing. This will be deployed onto a persistent public server in the future so devs dont have to run it themselves.

Finally, there are a pair of standalone versions of the TcpProxy Rust SDK module for developers to begin experimenting with sending app traffic through them mixnet.
