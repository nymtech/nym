# Credentials

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">

Right now we are still working on the specifics of how credentials will work for developers; this page serves as a stub with what information we do currently have.

</Callout>

Once the [zk-nym](../../network/cryptography/zk-nym) credential system is turned on, all Nym clients will have to present a valid credential to their Gateway on connection.

We plan to supply developers with a credential faucet for their applications, and a pay-per-play backend for large existing applications that wish to integrate and supply their users' with credentials under the hood.

> Remember, due to the [rerandomisation](../../network/cryptography/zk-nym/rerandomise) properties of the zk-nym scheme, that an application supplies a user with a credential in no way affects any privacy properties: the user will always present unlinkable rerandomised credential data to whatever Gateway their app instance connects to!
