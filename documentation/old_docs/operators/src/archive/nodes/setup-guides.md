To setup any type of Nym's node, start with building [Nym's platform](../../binaries/building-nym.md) on the machine (VPS) where you want to run the node. Nodes will need to be bond to Nym's wallet, setup one [here](https://nymtech.net/docs/wallet/desktop-wallet.html).

This section contains setup guides for the following node types:
* [Mix Node](mix-node-setup.md)
* [Gateway](gateway-setup.md)
* [Network Requester](network-requester-setup.md)
* [Validator](../../nodes/validator-setup.md)
