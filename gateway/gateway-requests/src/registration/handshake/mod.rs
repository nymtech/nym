Registration phase (Secure channel establishment using STS):
=== INIT CLIENT ==
1. Alice generates a random value x and computes g^x
2. Alice sends g^x to Gateway
== INIT GATE ==
3. Gateway generates a random value y and computes g^y
== MID GATE ==
4. Gateway computes the shared secret key k = KDF(gxy)  // As KDF we can use BLAKE3 instead of HKDF<SHA256> since BLAKE3 is ~15x faster than SHA256
5. Gateway concatenates (g^y, g^x), then signs them using its private key xG as sig = Sign(xG ,  (g^y, g^x)) and then encrypts the signature with k as c1 = AES(k, sig). This should be sent only once, so we can use IV of 0s.
6. Gateway sends g^y and c1 to Alice
== MID CLIENT ==
7. Alice computes the shared secret key k = KDF(gx)y
8. Using k Alice decrypts c1 and verifies Gatewayâ€™s signature using its public key yG
9. Alice concatenates (g^x, g^y), signs them using her private key xA as sigA = Sign(xA ,  (g^x, g^y)) and then encrypts using the signature with key k as c2 = AES(k, sigA).
10. Again, this should be sent only once, so we can use IV of 0s.
11. She sends c2 to the Gateway (no need to send g^x since it was already done in step 2.)
== FINAL GATE ==
12. Gateway decrypts c2 and verifies Alice's signature sigA using her public key yA
== FINAL CLIENT ==
13. So Gateway stores g^xA : k in a safe way in some dictionary etc.
