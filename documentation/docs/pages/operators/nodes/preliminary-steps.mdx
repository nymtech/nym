# Preliminary Steps

> The `nym-node` binary was built in the [building nym](../binaries/building-nym.md) section. If you haven't yet built Nym and want to run the code, go there first.

There are a couple of steps that need completing before starting to set up your `nym-node`:

1. **[Prepare your wallet](preliminary-steps/wallet-preparation.mdx):** [desktop](https://nymtech.net/docs/wallet/desktop-wallet.html) or [CLI](../../developers/tools/nym-cli/commands.mdx).
2. **[Requisition and setup a VPS](preliminary-steps/vps-setup.mdx)** (Virtual Private Server)

Make sure to follow these steps carefully as it prevents a lot of troubleshooting later on.
