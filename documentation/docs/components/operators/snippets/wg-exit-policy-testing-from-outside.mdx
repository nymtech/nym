Here are a few ways you can ensre your WireGuard exit policy is working correctly from the outside.

<Steps>

###### 1. Using NymVPN

- Connect to NymVPN and use your node as an Exit Gateway in dVPN (2-hop) mode

- While connected to NymVPN, navigate to [`portquiz.net:12345`](http://portquiz.net:12345) and see if you can load the page

- It shouldn't load, but if you navigate to some of the accepted ports, like[`portquiz.net:443`](http://portquiz.net:443) it should all work

###### 2. Test it from your local terminal

- Install these dependencies on your local machine:
```shell
sudo apt install tcpdump

sudo tcpdump -i nymwg -n
```
- Connect to [NymVPN](https://nym.com) and select your node as an Exit Gateway

- Run the `tcpdump` command before registering

- Have the output of the `echo $BLOCKED_IP` from your node and try to go into your browser or a registered client and try to connect - It should not resolve
