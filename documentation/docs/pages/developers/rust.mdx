  There will be a breaking SDK upgrade in the coming months. This upgrade will make the SDK a lot easier to build with.

This upgrade will affect the interface of the SDK dramatically, and will be coupled with a protocol change - stay tuned for information on early access to the new protocol testnet.

It will also be coupled with the documentation of the SDK on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

The Rust SDK allows developers building applications in Rust to import and interact with Nym clients as they would any other dependency, instead of running the client as a separate process on their machine.

Check the [development status](./rust/development-status) page to see the various modules that make up the SDK, and the [FFI](./rust/ffi) page for Go/C++ developers.
