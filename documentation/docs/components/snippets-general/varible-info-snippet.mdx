> Our guides sometimes refer to syntax noted in `<>` brackets. We use it for variables which are unique to each user (like path, local moniker, versions etcetra). Any syntax in `<>` brackets needs to be substituted with your correct name or version, without the `<>` brackets. If you are unsure, please check our table of essential [parameters and variables](https://nymtech.net/operators/variables.html).
