  There will be a breaking SDK upgrade in the coming months. This upgrade will make the SDK a lot easier to build with.

This upgrade will affect the interface of the SDK dramatically, and will be coupled with a protocol change - stay tuned for information on early access to the new protocol testnet.

It will also be coupled with the documentation of the SDK on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

Lets look at a very simple example of how you can import and use the websocket client in a piece of Rust code.

Simply importing the `nym_sdk` crate into your project allows you to create a client and send traffic through the mixnet.

> You can find this code [here](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/master/sdk/rust/nym-sdk/examples/simple.rs)

```rust
use nym_sdk::mixnet;
use nym_sdk::mixnet::MixnetMessageSender;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    nym_bin_common::logging::setup_logging();

    // Passing no config makes the client fire up an ephemeral session and figure shit out on its own
    let mut client = mixnet::MixnetClient::connect_new().await.unwrap();

    // Be able to get our client address
    let our_address = client.nym_address();
    println!("Our client nym address is: {our_address}");

    // Send a message through the mixnet to ourselves
    client
        .send_plain_message(*our_address, "hello there")
        .await
        .unwrap();

    println!("Waiting for message (ctrl-c to exit)");
    client
        .on_messages(|msg| println!("Received: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&msg.message)))
        .await;
}
```
