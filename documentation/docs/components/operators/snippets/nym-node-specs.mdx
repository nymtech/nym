### VPS Hardware Specs

You will need to rent a VPS to run your node on. One key reason for this is that your node **must be able to send TCP data using both IPv4 and IPv6** (as other nodes you talk to may use either protocol). Therefore you will need a server with static IPv4 and IPv6!

Tor community created a very helpful table called [*Good Bad ISPs*](https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/good-bad-isps/), you can use that one as a guideline for your choice of ISP for your VPS.

**Update:** Nym community started an ISP table called [*Where to host your nym node?*](../../community-counsel/isp-list.mdx), check it out and add your findings!

#### `nym-node`
Before we conclude the testing with exact results, these are the rough specs:

| **Hardware** | **Minimum Specification** w
| :---         | ---:                      |
| CPU Cores    | 4                         |
| Memory       | 8 GB RAM                  |
| Storage      | 80 GB                     |
| Connectivity | IPv4, IPv6, TCP/IP, UDP   |
| Bandwidth    | > 1Tb                     |
| Port speed   | 1Gbps                     |

#### Nyx validator

The specification mentioned below is for running a full node alongside the nym-api. It is recommended to run `nym-api` and a full Nyx node on the same machine for optimum performance.

Bear in mind that credential signing is primarily CPU-bound, so choose the fastest CPU available to you.
