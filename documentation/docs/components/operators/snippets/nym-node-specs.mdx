### VPS Hardware Specs

You will need to rent a VPS to run your node on. One key reason for this is that your node **must be able to send TCP data using both IPv4 and IPv6** (as other nodes you talk to may use either protocol). Therefore you will need a server with static IPv4 and IPv6!

Tor community created a very helpful table called [*Good Bad ISPs*](https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/good-bad-isps/), you can use that one as a guideline for your choice of ISP for your VPS.

**Update:** Nym community initiated an ISP table called [*Where to host your nym node?*](https://nym.com/docs/operators/community-counsel/isp-list), check it out and add your findings!

#### `nym-node` - dedicated server
If you are about to start a new Nym Node, look for a server with this specification:

| **Hardware**   | **Minimum Specification**          |
| :---           | ---:                               |
| Type of server | Dedicated or bare metal            |
| CPU Cores      | 4                                  |
| Memory         | 8-16 GB RAM                        |
| Storage        | 50 GB (preferably 80 GB)           |
| Connectivity   | IPv4, IPv6, TCP/IP, UDP            |
| Bandwidth      | Unmetered if possible, or \> 40Tb  |
| Port speed     | 1Gbps                              |

#### Nyx validator

The specification mentioned below is for running a full node alongside the nym-api. It is recommended to run `nym-api` and a full Nyx node on the same machine for optimum performance.

Bear in mind that credential signing is primarily CPU-bound, so choose the fastest CPU available to you.

##### Minimum Requirements

| Hardware | **Minimum Specification**                  |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| CPU      | 8-cores, 2.8GHz base clock speed or higher |
| RAM      | 16GB DDR4+                                 |
| Disk     | 500 GiB+ NVMe SSD                          |

##### Recommended Requirements

| Hardware | **Minimum Specification**                   |
