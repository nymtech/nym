# Echo Server

There is an initial version of a simple echo server located at [`nym/tools/echo-server`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/tools/echo-server).

This is an initial minimal implementation of an echo server built using the [`NymProxyServer`](../rust/tcpproxy) Rust SDK abstraction that, aside from the initialisation and running of a `NymProxyServer` instance in the background, is essentially a vanilla TCP echo server written with `tokio`.

You can find usage commands [here](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/tools/echo-server#usage).

This server was initially built for the `TcpProxy` tests, but can be useful for developers to need a constant endpoint to ping when developing. In the future this will be deployed to a remote server so developers don't have to run their own.

## Logging
Every 10 seconds, the server logs:
- the total number of bytes received since startup
- the total number of bytes sent since startup
- the current number of concurrent connections it has
- the total number of concurrent connections it has
