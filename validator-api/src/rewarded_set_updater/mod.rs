// there is couple of reasons for putting this in a separate module:
// 1. I didn't feel it fit well in validator "cache". It seems like purpose of cache is to just keep updating local data
//    rather than attempting to change global view (i.e. the active set)
//
// 2. However, even if it was to exist in the validator cache refresher, we'd have to create a different "run"
//    method as it doesn't have access to the signing client which we need in the case of updating rewarded sets
//    (because validator cache can be run by anyone regardless of whether, say, network monitor exists)
//
// 3. Eventually this whole procedure is going to get expanded to allow for distribution of rewarded set generation
//    and hence this might be a good place for it.
