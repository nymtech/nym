# HTML Nym Mixnet Chat App bundled with Parcel

This is an example of using the Nym Mixnet to send text chat messages in an app bundled with Parcel 2.0.

You can use this example as a seed for a new project.

You will need to have the Rust WASM toolchain installed. Please [follow the instructions here](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/setup.html)
to install `wasm-pack` and then run the sample.

yarn
yarn start
