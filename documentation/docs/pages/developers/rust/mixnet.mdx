# Mixnet Module

This module exposes the logic of creating and interacting with clients and Mixnet messages. This is recommended for those wanting to either start playing around with the Mixnet and how it works, or build connection logic.

> For developers wanting something more 'plug and play' we recommend the [`TcpProxy` module](./tcpproxy).
