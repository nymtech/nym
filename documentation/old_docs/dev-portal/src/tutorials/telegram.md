The purpose of the following manual is not to promote Telegram but so people can use it with the Nym mixnet if they wish to, should a situation ask for that. This privacy-enhances Telegram at the network level and allows users to access the application from locations like where the application was banned.

## Setup & Run

Hereâ€™s how to configure Telegram with NymConnect:

1. **Download and install NymConnect(https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/).**
	For more releases, check out [Github](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tags). NymConnect is available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS.
	On Linux make sure NymConnect is executable. Opening a terminal in the same directory and run:
	```sh
	chmod +x ./<VERSION>
	```    
2. **Start NymConnect**
	Telegram is added to NymConnect by default.
3. **Click connect - the host and port will now be displayed.**
4. **Click on host or port to copy** the value to the clipboard.
5. **Open the Telegram proxy settings.**
	Linux: Telegram -> Settings -> Advanced -> Connection type -> Use custom proxy
	MacOS: Telegram -> Settings -> Advanced -> Data & Storage ->  Connection Type -> Use custom Proxy
	Windows: Telegram -> Settings -> Data and Storage -> Use proxy
6. **Add a proxy** with the Add proxy button.
7. **Select SOCKS5** and make sure the port details are the same as those generated by NymConnect. Alternatively, follow this link: https://t.me/socks?server=127.0.0.1&port=1080
8. **Save the proxy settings** in Telegram.
9. **Telegram is now running through the Nym Mixnet and is privacy-enhanced!**
	This allows you to connect from regions which blocked Telegram.
10. Note if you remain idle on Telegram for a while you might lose connectivity and your messages might not get through via SOCKS5 proxy. If that happens reconnect your NymConnect and reset the proxy again.
