Tutorial code in this section is built to interact with a standalone Nym client. You can read about interacting with standalone clients [here](https://nymtech.net/docs/clients/websocket-client.html#connecting-to-the-local-websocket), although it is usually preferable to use the [Typescript SDK](https://sdk.nymtech.net/).
