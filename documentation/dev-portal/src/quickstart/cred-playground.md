# Coconut Credential Playground (webapp)

There is a coconut-scheme based Credential Library playground [here](https://coco-demo.nymtech.net/). This is a WASM implementation of our Coconut libraries which generate raw Coconut credentials. Test it to create and re-randomize your own credentials.

For more information on what is happening here check out the [Coconut docs](https://nymtech.net/docs/coconut.html).
