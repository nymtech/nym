# Configuring your client
When you initalise a client instance, a configuration directory will be generated and stored in `$HOME_DIR/.nym/socks5-clients/<client-name>/`.

```
tree $HOME/<user>/.nym/socks5-clients/docs-example
├── config
│   └── config.toml
└── data
    ├── ack_key.pem
    ├── credentials_database.db
    ├── gateway_shared.pem
    ├── persistent_reply_store.sqlite
    ├── private_encryption.pem
    ├── private_identity.pem
    ├── public_encryption.pem
    └── public_identity.pem

```

The `config.toml` file contains client configuration options, while the two `pem` files contain client key information.

The generated files contain the client name, public/private keypairs, and gateway address. The name `<client_id>` in the example above is just a local identifier so that you can name your clients.

#### Configuring your client for Docker
By default, the native client listens to host `127.0.0.1`. However this can be an issue if you wish to run a client in a Dockerized environment, where it can be convenenient to listen on a different host such as `0.0.0.0`.

You can set this via the `--host` flag during either the `init` or `run` commands.

Alternatively, a custom host can be set in the `config.toml` file under the `socket` section. If you do this, remember to restart your client process.
