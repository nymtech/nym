# Overview

The Typescript SDK's different modules allow developers to start building browser-based applications quickly, by simply importing the SDK module of their choice - depending on the component from the Nym architecture they want to use - into their code via NPM as they would any other Typescript library.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    SDK modules come in four different flavours (ESM, CJS, simple and full-fat). We will primarily focus on exemplifying simple ESM module versions during the installation walkthroughs given that they most likely will be the most used ones.

#### Install all

```
npm install @nymproject/contract-clients @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate @cosmjs/proto-signing @nymproject/sdk @nymproject/mix-fetch --save
```

## Nyx chain
#### Overview
The Nyx blockchain is a general-purpose CosmWasm-enabled smart contract platform, and the home of the smart contracts which keep track of the mixnet, amongst others.
Information about the chain can be found on the [Nyx blockchain explorer](https://nym.explorers.guru/).

Using the [contract clients](https://nymtech.net/docs/nyx/smart-contracts.html) (Mixnet, Vesting, Coconut), you will be able to query contract states or execute methods when providing a signing key.

*You can learn about our different methods to interact with the chain [here](https://nymtech.net/docs/nyx/interacting-with-chain.html)*. 

#### Installation: Contract Clients
In order to query or execute on any of the Nyx contracts, you'll need to use the [`Contract Clients`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/contract-clients), which contains read-only query and signing clients for all Nyx's smart contracts.

First install the package and its dependencies from Cosmos Stargate:

```
npm install @nymproject/contract-clients @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate @cosmjs/proto-signing --save
```

## Mixnet
#### Overview
The [Nym mixnet](https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/network-overview.html) provides very strong security guarantees against network-level surveillance. It wraps into packets and mixes together IP traffic from many users inside the mixnet. It encrypts and mixes [Sphinx packet](https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/Sphinx_Oakland09.pdf) traffic so that it cannot be determined who is communicating with whom. Our mixnet is based on a modified version of the Loopix design.

*You can explore our mixnet using our [mixnet explorer](https://nymtech.net/docs/explorers/mixnet-explorer.html) here.*


#### Installation: Mixnet Client
In order to send or receive traffic over the mixnet, you'll need to use the [`Mixnet Client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk).

First install the package and its dependencies:

```
npm install @nymproject/sdk --save
```

## MixFetch
#### Overview
MixFetch is a drop-in replacement for fetch that fetches responses through the Mixnet. It does this by grabbing the same arguments as traditional fetch and constructing the internal requests to a [Network Requester](https://nymtech.net/docs/nodes/network-requester.html).

#### Installation: MixFetch package
In order to fetch data through mixFetch you'll need to use the [`MixFetch package`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/mix-fetch).

First install the package and its dependencies:

```
npm install @nymproject/mix-fetch --save
```

## Coconut
#### Overview
Coconut is a blinded, re-randomizable, selective disclosure threshold credential signature scheme that lets application programmers who are concerned with resource access control to think and code in a new way.

*Learn more about [Coconut](https://nymtech.net/docs/coconut.html) here!*

#### Installation: Coconut
In order to make use of the Coconut signature scheme, you'll need to leverage the [`Coconut Client`]().

First install the package and its dependencies:

```
npm install @nymproject/???
```
