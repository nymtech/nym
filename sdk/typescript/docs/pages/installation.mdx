# Overview

The different modules in the Typescript SDK allow developers to start building browser-based applications quickly. Simply import the SDK module of your choice – depending on the component from the Nym architecture you want to use – into your code via NPM, as you would any other TypeScript library.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Other than the `Contract Clients`, SDK modules come in four different flavours (ESM, CJS and full-fat for ESM and CJS).
    This documentation focuses on examples using the `full-fat` versions.

#### Install all

```bash
npm install @nymproject/contract-clients @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate @cosmjs/proto-signing @nymproject/sdk-full-fat @nymproject/mix-fetch-full-fat 
```

## MixFetch
#### Overview
MixFetch is a drop-in replacement for [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) that sends HTTP requests through the Nym mixnet. It does this by grabbing the same arguments as traditional fetch and constructing a SOCKS5 request that will be made to the destination host on the Internet via a [SOCKS5](https://nymtech.net/developers/quickstart/socks-proxy.html) [Network Requester](https://nymtech.net/docs/nodes/network-requester.html).

#### Installation: MixFetch package
In order to fetch data through mixFetch you'll need to use the [`MixFetch package`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/mix-fetch).

First install the package and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install @nymproject/mix-fetch-full-fat 
```

## Mixnet
#### Overview
The [Nym mixnet](https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/network-overview.html) provides extremely robust protection against network-level surveillance. It splits data into smaller, identically sized,[Sphinx encrypted packet](https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/Sphinx_Oakland09.pdf), which are then mixed in with dummy traffic and dispersed through Nym nodes around the world at randomised intervals. Finally these are decrypted and reassembled, preventing the observation of metadata and providing pattern privacy so that it cannot be determined who is communicating with whom. The Nym mixnet is based on a modified version of the [Loopix design](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/usenixsecurity17_slides_piotrowska.pdf).

*You can explore the Nym mixnet using the [mixnet explorer](https://nymtech.net/docs/explorers/mixnet-explorer.html) here.*


#### Installation: Mixnet Client
In order to send or receive traffic over the mixnet, you'll need to use the [`Mixnet Client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk).

First install the package and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install @nymproject/sdk-full-fat 
```



## Nym Smart Contracts
#### Overview
The Nyx blockchain is a general-purpose CosmWasm-enabled smart contract platform, and the home of the smart contracts which keep track of the mixnet, amongst others.
Further information about the chain can be found on the [Nyx blockchain explorer](https://nym.explorers.guru/).

Using the [Nym mixnet smart contract clients](https://nymtech.net/docs/nyx/smart-contracts.html), you will be able to query contract states or execute methods when providing a signing key.

*You can learn about our different methods to interact with the chain [here](https://nymtech.net/docs/nyx/interacting-with-chain.html)*.

#### Installation: Contract Clients
In order to query or execute on any of the Nym smart contracts, you'll need to use the [`Contract Clients`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/contract-clients), which contains read-only query and signing clients for all Nyx's smart contracts.

First install the package and its dependencies from Cosmos Stargate:

```bash
npm install @nymproject/contract-clients @cosmjs/cosmwasm-stargate @cosmjs/proto-signing 
```
