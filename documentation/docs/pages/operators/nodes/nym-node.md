# Nym Node

```admonish note
If you are a `nym-mixnode` or `nym-gateway` operator and you are not familiar with the binary changes called *Project Smoosh*, you can read the archived [Smoosh FAQ](../archive/faq/smoosh-faq.md) page.
```

NYM NODE is a tool for running a node within the Nym network. Nym Nodes containing functionality such as `mixnode`, `entry-gateway` and `exit-gateway` are fundamental components of Nym Mixnet architecture. Nym Nodes are ran by decentralised node operators.

To setup any type of Nym Node, start with either building [Nym's platform](../binaries/building-nym.md) from source or download [pre-compiled binaries](../binaries/pre-built-binaries.md) on the [configured server (VPS)](vps-setup.md) where you want to run the node. Your Nym Node will need to be bonded before it can be run. We recommend most users use the [Nym desktop wallet](wallet-preparation.md) for this.

**Follow [preliminary steps](preliminary-steps.md) page before you configure and run a `nym-node`!**

## Steps for Nym Node Operators

Once [VPS and Nym wallet are configured](preliminary-steps.md), binaries ready, the operators of `nym-node` need to:

1. **[Setup](setup.md) the node**

2. **[Configure](configuration.md) the node and optionally automation, Wireguard, WSS, reversed proxy ...**

3. **[Run](setup.md#initialise--run) the node or [the service](configuration.md#following-steps-for-nym-nodes-running-as-systemd-service)**

4. **[Bond](bonding.md) the node to the Nym API, using Nym wallet**

Make sure to follow the steps thoroughly, in case you find any point difficult don't hesitate to ask in our [Operators channel](https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat).

## Quick `nym-node --mode exit-gateway` Setup

During the testing events series [Fast and Furious](https://nymtech.net/events/fast-and-furious) we found out, that after introducing IP Packet Router and [Nym exit policy](https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/exit-policy.txt) as default features,  only a fragment of Exit Gateways routes correctly through IPv4 and IPv6. We built a useful monitor to check out your Gateway (`nym-node --mode exit-gateway`) at [harbourmaster.nymtech.net](https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/).

Below is a fast - *ten command* - deployment for seasoned operators to migrate and setup the node, configure networking and connectivity and verify that it all works as it should by getting two free jokes through the Mixnet.

```admonish caution
If you are not well familiar with `nym-node` setup, automation, and `nymtun0` configuration, follow the [steps above](#steps-for-nym-node-operators) page by page. You can use this flow as a reference later on.
```

1. [Get](../binaries/pre-built-binaries.md) or [build](../binaries/building-nym.md) the latest `nym-node` binary

2. Get [network_tunnel_manager.sh](https://gist.github.com/tommyv1987/ccf6ca00ffb3d7e13192edda61bb2a77) script and grant permissions
```sh
curl -o network_tunnel_manager.sh -L https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tommyv1987/ccf6ca00ffb3d7e13192edda61bb2a77/raw/9d785d6ee3aa2970553633eccbd89a827f49fab5/network_tunnel_manager.sh && chmod +x network_tunnel_manager.sh
```

3. In case you had a`nym-gateway` running, stop the process (directly or systemd service), and [**migrate to `nym-node`**](setup.md#migrate) now!

4. Apply the rules:
```sh
sudo ./network_tunnel_manager.sh apply_iptables_rules
```
5. Check Nymtun IP tables:
```sh
sudo ./network_tunnel_manager.sh check_nymtun_iptables
```

6. Display IPv6:
```sh
sudo ./network_tunnel_manager.sh fetch_and_display_ipv6
```
 - You should see a `global ipv6` address:
~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="Correct `./network_tunnel_manager.sh fetch_and_display_ipv6` output:"
```sh
iptables-persistent is already installed.
Using IPv6 address: 2001:db8:a160::1/112 #the address will be different for you
operation fetch_ipv6_address_nym_tun completed successfully.
```
~~~

7. (If you didn't have a `nym-node` service yet) Create `systemd` [automation and configuration file](configuration.md#systemd), reload and enable the service

8. Start `nym-node` service:
```sh
sudo service nym-node start && journalctl -u nym-node -f -n 100
```
9. Upgrade your node version in the smart contract, [using Nym wallet](manual-upgrade.md#step-2-updating-your-node-information-in-the-smart-contract)
  - If you don't run this as an upgrade but started a fresh new node, you need to [bond](bonding.md) the gateway now. After that finish the verification steps below.

10. After a minute of running properly, validate your `nymtun0` routing:

  - Display the address 
```sh
ip addr show nymtun0
```

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="Correct `ip addr show nymtun0` output:"
```sh
# your addresses will be different
8: nymtun0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1420 qdisc fq_codel state UNKNOWN group default qlen 500
    link/none
    inet 10.0.0.1/16 scope global nymtun0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 2001:db8:a160::1/112 scope global
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::ad08:d167:5700:8c7c/64 scope link stable-privacy
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever`
```
~~~

  - Run a joke through the Mixnet - you should get two jokes (IPv4 and IPv6 routing):

```sh
sudo ./network_tunnel_manager.sh joke_through_the_mixnet
```
