# Zk-Nym Contract

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Note that within the monorepo contract repo this contract is referred to as `ecash`. This is a historical artifact that hasn't yet been changed.
</Callout>

This contract is a hub for zk-nym related actions, being called by either:
- the zk-nym payment backend
- nodes running in Gateway mode
- the multisig contract

### Functionality

- The following functionality is controlled by the multisig contract:
  - getting the list of blacklisted addresses who have tried to double-spend a zk-nym.
  - proposing to add an address to the blacklist.
  - executing an open proposal.

- The the zk-nym [payment backend](../../../cryptography/zk-nym/zk-nym-overview) can deposit funds with information used to identify the deposit.

- Finally, nodes running as Gateways can create a proposal to redeem a set of spend zk-nyms.

> The addresses of deployed smart contracts can be found in the [`network-defaults`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/master/common/network-defaults/src/mainnet.rs) directory of the codebase alongside other network default values.
