# Vesting Contract

The vesting contract allows for the creation of vesting accounts, allowing `NYM` tokens to vest over time, and for users to minimally interact with the Mixnet using their unvested tokens. You can find the code and build instructions [here](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/master/contracts/vesting).

### Functionality
The Vesting contract has multiple functions:
* Creating and storing vesting `NYM` token vesting accounts.
* Interacting with the Mixnet using vesting (i.e. non-transferable) tokens, allowing users to delegate their unvested tokens.

> The addresses of deployed smart contracts can be found in the [`network-defaults`](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/master/common/network-defaults/src/mainnet.rs) directory of the codebase alongside other network default values.
