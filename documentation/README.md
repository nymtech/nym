# Documentation

## Doc projects
Each directory contains a readme with more information about running and contributing to the projects. Each is built with [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) - use `mdbook serve` to build and serve them (defaults to `localhost:3000`).
* `docs` contains technical documentation hosted at [https://nymtech.net/docs](https://nymtech.net/docs)
* `dev-portal` contains developer documentation hosted at [https://nymtech.net/developers](https://nymtech.net/developers)
* `operators` contains node setup and maintenance guides hosted at [https://nymtech.net/operators](https://nymtech.net/operators)

## Scripts 
* `bump_versions.sh` allows you to update the ~~`platform_release_version` and~~ `wallet_release_version` variable~~s~~ in the `book.toml` of each mdbook project at once. You can also optionally update the `minimum_rust_version` as well. Helpful for lazy-updating when cutting a new version of the docs. 
* `build_all_to_dist.sh` is used by the `ci-dev.yml` and `cd-dev.yml` scripts for building all mdbook projects and moving the rendered html to `../dist/` to be rsynced with various servers. 
* `post_process.sh` is a script called by the github CI and CD workflows to post process CSS/image/href links for serving several mdbooks from a subdirectory.
