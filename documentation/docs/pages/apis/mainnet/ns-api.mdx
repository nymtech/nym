# Node Status API

The Node Status API contains information about the network, its topology, and the routing scores of all nodes within it. It offers broadly similar information to the experimental [Habourmaster frontend](https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/) but aims to be more stable.

People building applications or dashboards which requires information about nodes, their uptime, and their delegations should **use this instead of Habourmaster**.

The code for this service can be found [in our monorepo](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/nym-node-status-api). In the future we will encourage developers to run their own instance of this API in order to distribute endpoints and query load.

The information below is generated with [Redoc](https://redocly.com/docs/redoc) consuming the OpenAPI spec found at [https://mainnet-node-status-api.nymtech.cc/api-docs/openapi.json](https://mainnet-node-status-api.nymtech.cc/api-docs/openapi.json) which is also used to generate the Swagger docs deployed at [https://mainnet-node-status-api.nymtech.cc/swagger/](https://mainnet-node-status-api.nymtech.cc/swagger/).
