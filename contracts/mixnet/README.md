# Nym Mixnet Contract

This is the [cosmwasm](https://www.cosmwasm.com) smart contract which runs the Nym mixnet.

## Compiling in development

```
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
```

## CI Support

We have template configurations for both [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/Basic.yml)
and [Circle CI](.circleci/config.yml) in the generated project, so you can
get up and running with CI right away.

One note is that the CI runs all `cargo` commands
with `--locked` to ensure it uses the exact same versions as you have locally. This also means
you must have an up-to-date `Cargo.lock` file, which is not auto-generated.
The first time you set up the project (or after adding any dep), you should ensure the
`Cargo.lock` file is updated, so the CI will test properly. This can be done simply by
running `cargo check` or `cargo unit-test`.

## Using your project

Once you have your custom repo, you should check out [Developing](./Developing.md) to explain
more on how to run tests and develop code. Or go through the
[online tutorial](https://www.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/intro) to get a better feel
of how to develop.

[Publishing](./Publishing.md) contains useful information on how to publish your contract
to the world, once you are ready to deploy it on a running blockchain. And
[Importing](./Importing.md) contains information about pulling in other contracts or crates
that have been published.

Please replace this README file with information about your specific project. You can keep
the `Developing.md` and `Publishing.md` files as useful referenced, but please set some
proper description in the README.
