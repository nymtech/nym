# Nym Node Configuration

## Basic Changes

Nym Node can be configured directly by editing the config file (`config.toml`) located at `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<ID>/config/config.toml` (by default `~/.nym/nym-nodes/default-nym-node/config/config.toml`) or through commands on the binary.

### Node Description

Operators can add a description themselves to share more information about their `nym-node` publicly.

To add or change `nym-node` description is done by editing `description.toml` file located in `~/.nym/nym-nodes/<NODE_ID>/data/description.toml`. After saving, don't forget to reload and restart your node [service](#systemd) or simply restart your `nym-node` if you run it without a service (not recommended).

**Query description**

Nodes description can be queried from API endpoint `/api/v1/description` or via Swagger API UI page `/api/v1/swagger/#/Node/description`.

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://<NODE_IP_ADDRESS>:8080/api/v1/description' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'

# or for https reversed proxy or WSS setup

curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://<HOSTNAME>/api/v1/description' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

### Commands & Examples

Disable sharing of system hardware info with the network:

```sh
./nym-node run --id <ID> --deny-init --mode entry-gateway -w --expose-system-hardware false --expose-system-info false
```

Note: `--expose-system-info false` supersedes `--expose-system-hardware false`. If both are present with conflicting values, the system hardware will not be shown.


## VPS Setup and Automation

> Replace `<NODE>` variable with type of node you run, preferably `nym-node` (depreciated `nym-mixnode`, `nym-gateway` or `nym-network-requester`).

### Automating your node with nohup, tmux and systemd

Although itâ€™s not totally necessary, it's useful to have the Mix Node automatically start at system boot time. We recommend to run your remote operation via [`tmux`](maintenance.md#tmux) for easier management and a handy return to your previous session. For full automation, including a failed node auto-restart and `ulimit` setup, [`systemd`](maintenance.md#systemd) is a good choice.

> Do any of these steps and run your automated node before you start bonding process!

#### nohup

`nohup` is a command with which your terminal is told to ignore the `HUP` or 'hangup' signal. This will stop the node process ending if you kill your session.

```sh
nohup ./<NODE> run <OTHER_FLAGS> # use all the flags you use to run your node
```

#### tmux

One way is to use `tmux` shell on top of your current VPS terminal. Tmux is a terminal multiplexer, it allows you to create several terminal windows and panes from a single terminal. Processes started in `tmux` keep running after closing the terminal as long as the given `tmux` window was not terminated.

Use the following command to get `tmux`.

| Platform | Install Command |
| :---      | :---             |
| Arch Linux|`pacman -S tmux`             |
| Debian or Ubuntu|`apt install tmux`      |
| Fedora|`dnf install tmux`                 |
| RHEL or CentOS|`yum install tmux`          |
|  macOS (using Homebrew | `brew install tmux`    |
| macOS (using MacPorts) | `port install tmux`    |
|               openSUSE | `zypper install tmux`  |

In case it didn't work for your distribution, see how to build `tmux` from [version control](https://github.com/tmux/tmux#from-version-control).

**Running tmux**

Now you have installed tmux on your VPS, let's run a Mix Node on tmux, which allows you to detach your terminal and let your `<NODE>` run on its own on the VPS.

* Pause your `<NODE>`
* Start tmux with the command
```sh
tmux
```
* The tmux terminal should open in the same working directory, just the layout changed into tmux default layout.
* Start the `<NODE>` again with a command:
```sh
./<NODE> run <OTHER_FLAGS> # use all the flags you use to run your node
```
* Now, without closing the tmux window, you can close the whole terminal and the `<NODE>` (and any other process running in tmux) will stay active.
* Next time just start your teminal, ssh into the VPS and run the following command to attach back to your previous session:
```sh
tmux attach-session
```
* To see keybinding options of tmux press `ctrl`+`b` and after 1 second `?`

#### systemd

To automate with `systemd` use this init service file by saving it as `/etc/systemd/system/nym-node.service` and follow the [next steps](#following-steps-for-nym-nodes-running-as-systemd-service).

1. Open the service file in a text editor
```sh
nano /etc/systemd/system/nym-node.service
```

2. Paste this config file
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Nym Node
StartLimitInterval=350
StartLimitBurst=10

[Service]
User=<USER>
LimitNOFILE=65536
ExecStart=/home/<USER>/<PATH>/nym-node run # add all the flags you use to run your node
KillSignal=SIGINT
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```admonish warning title=""
[Accepting T&Cs](setup.md#terms--conditions) is done via a flag `--accept-operator-terms-and-conditions` added explicitly to `nym-node run` command every time. If you use systemd automation, add the flag to your service file's `ExecStart` line.
```

3. Save the file

```admonish note
Make sure your `ExecStart <FULL_PATH>` and `run` command are correct!

Example: If you have built nym in the `$HOME` directory on your server, your username is `jetpanther`, and node `<ID>` is `puma`, then the `ExecStart` line (command) in the script located in `/etc/systemd/system/nym-mixnode.service` for Nym Mixnode might look like this:
`ExecStart=/home/jetpanther/nym/target/release/nym-node run --id puma`.

Basically, you want the full `/<PATH>/<TO>/nym-mixnode run --id <WHATEVER-YOUR-NODE-ID-IS>`. If you are unsure about your `/<PATH>/<TO>/<NODE>`, then `cd` to your directory where you run your `<NODE>` from and run `pwd` command which returns the full path for you.
```


#### Following steps for Nym nodes running as `systemd` service

Once your init file is save follow these steps:

1. Reload systemctl to pickup the new unit file
```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
```

2. Enable the newly created service:

```sh
systemctl enable nym-node.service
```

3. Start your `<NODE>` as a `systemd` service:

```sh
service nym-node start
```

This will cause your `<NODE>` to start at system boot time. If you restart your machine, your `<NODE>` will come back up automatically.

**Useful systemd commands**

- You can monitor system logs of your node by running:
```sh
journalctl -u nym-node -f
```

- Or check a status by running:
```sh
systemctl status <NODE>.service
# for example systemctl status nym-node.service
```

- You can also do `service <NODE> stop` or `service <NODE> restart`.

**Note:** if you make any changes to your `systemd` script after you've enabled it, you will need to run:

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
```

This lets your operating system know it's ok to reload the service configuration. Then restart your `<NODE>`.


## Connectivity Test and Configuration

During our ongoing testing events [Fast and Furious](https://nymtech.net/events/fast-and-furious) we found out, that after introducing IP Packet Router (IPR) and [Nym exit policy](https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/exit-policy.txt) on embedded Network Requester (NR) by default,  only a fragment of Gateways routes correctly through IPv4 and IPv6. We built a useful monitor to check out your Gateway (`nym-node --mode exit-gateway`) at [harbourmaster.nymtech.net](https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/).

IPv6 routing is not only a case for gateways. Imagine a rare occassion when you run a `mixnode` without IPv6 enabled and a client will sent IPv6 packets through the Mixnet through such route:
```ascii
[client] -> [entry-gateway] -> [mixnode layer 1] -> [your mixnode] -> [IPv6 mixnode layer3] -> [exit-gateway]
```
In this (unusual) case your `mixnode` will not be able to route the packets. The node will drop the packets and its performance would go down. For that reason it's beneficial to have IPv6 enabled when running a `mixnode` functionality.

### Quick IPv6 Check

```admonish caution
Make sure to keep your IPv4 address enabled while setting up IPv6, as the majority of routing goes through that one!
```

You can always check IPv6 address and connectivity by using some of these methods:

```sh
# locally listed IPv6 addresses
ip -6 addr

# globally reachable IPv6 addresses
ip -6 addr show scope global

# with DNS
dig -6 TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com
dig -t aaaa +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com

# https check
curl -6 https://ifconfig.co
curl -6 https://ipv6.icanhazip.com

# using telnet
telnet -6 ipv6.telnetmyip.com
```

### IPv6 Configuration

While we're working on Rust implementation to have these settings as a part of the binary build, we wrote a script to solve these connectivity requirements in the meantime we wrote a script [`network_tunnel_manager.sh`](https://gist.github.com/tommyv1987/ccf6ca00ffb3d7e13192edda61bb2a77) to support the operators to configure their servers and address all the connectivity requirements.

Networking configuration across different ISPs and various operation systems does not have a generic solution. If the provided configuration setup doesn't solve your problem check out [IPv6 troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/vps-isp.md#ipv6-troubleshooting) page. Be aware that you may have to do more research and customised adjustments.

#### Mode: `exit-gateway`

The `nymtun0` interface is dynamically managed by the `exit-gateway` service. When the service is stopped, `nymtun0` disappears, and when started, `nymtun0` is recreated.

The script should be used in a context where `nym-node --mode exit-gateway` is running to fully utilise its capabilities, particularly for fetching IPv6 addresses or applying network rules that depend on the `nymtun0` interface.

1. Download `network_tunnel_manager.sh`, make executable and run:

```sh
curl -o network_tunnel_manager.sh -L https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tommyv1987/ccf6ca00ffb3d7e13192edda61bb2a77/raw/9d785d6ee3aa2970553633eccbd89a827f49fab5/network_tunnel_manager.sh && chmod +x network_tunnel_manager.sh && ./network_tunnel_manager.sh
```

Here is a quick command explanation, for more details on the `network_tunnel_manager.sh` script, refer to the [overview](https://gist.github.com/tommyv1987/ccf6ca00ffb3d7e13192edda61bb2a77) under the code block.

  - To run the script next time, just enter `./network_tunnel_manager <ARG>`

2. Make sure your `nym-node --mode exit-gateway` service is up running

3. Check Nymtun IP tables:
```sh
sudo ./network_tunnel_manager.sh check_nymtun_iptables
```

```
~~~

 - If there's no process running it wouldn't return anything.
 - In case you see `nymtun0` but not active, this is probably because you are setting up a new (never bonded) node and not upgrading an exisitng one. In that case you need to [bond](bonding.md) your node now.

4. Display IPv6:
```sh
sudo ./network_tunnel_manager.sh fetch_and_display_ipv6
```
 - if you have a `global ipv6` address this is good

~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="Correct `./network_tunnel_manager.sh fetch_and_display_ipv6` output:"

Using IPv6 address: 2001:db8:a160::1/112 #the address will be different for you
operation fetch_ipv6_address_nym_tun completed successfully.
```
~~~

5. Apply the rules:
```sh
sudo ./network_tunnel_manager.sh apply_iptables_rules
```

  - The process may prompt you if you want to save current IPv4 and IPv6 rules, choose yes.

![](../images/ip_table_prompt.png)

   - check IPv6 again like in point 3

6. At this point your node needs to be [bonded](bonding.md) to the API for `nymtun0` to interact with the network. After bonding please follow up with the remaining streps below to ensure that your Exit Gateway is routing properly.

7. Check `nymtun0` interface:
```sh
ip addr show nymtun0
```
~~~admonish example collapsible=true title="Correct `ip addr show nymtun0` output:"
```sh
# your addresses will be different
8: nymtun0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1420 qdisc fq_codel state UNKNOWN group default qlen 500

       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever`
```
~~~

8. Validate your IPv6 and IPv4 networking by running a joke via Mixnet:
```sh
sudo ./network_tunnel_manager.sh joke_through_the_mixnet
```

Make sure that you get the validation of IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity. If there are still any problems, please refer to [troubleshooting section](../troubleshooting/vps-isp.md#incorrect-gateway-network-check).

#### Mode: `mixnode`

```admonish caution title=""
Most of the time the packets sent through the Mixnet are IPv4 based. The IPv6 packets are still pretty rare and therefore it's not mandatory from operational point of view. If you preparing to run a `nym-node` with all modes enabled once this option is implemented, then the IPv6 setup on your VPS is required.
```

1. Download `network_tunnel_manager.sh`, make executable and run:

```sh
curl -o network_tunnel_manager.sh -L https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tommyv1987/ccf6ca00ffb3d7e13192edda61bb2a77/raw/9d785d6ee3aa2970553633eccbd89a827f49fab5/network_tunnel_manager.sh && chmod +x network_tunnel_manager.sh && ./network_tunnel_manager.sh
```

## Next Steps

There are a few more good suggestions for `nym-node` VPS configuration, especially to be considered for `exit-gateway` functionality, like Web Secure Socket or Reversed Proxy setup. Visit [Proxy configuration](proxy-configuration.md) page to see the guides.
