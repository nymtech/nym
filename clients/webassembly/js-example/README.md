## ðŸš´ Usage

```

Check your dev console for output.

### Rebuild after Rust source changes

Install `wasm-pack`. Instruction are at the [Rust WASM tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/hello-world.html). 

`wasm-pack build` in the `clients/webassembly` directory (one up) will rebuild the wasm package if you make changes to the Rust source. That will be automatically picked up (and reloaded, if need be) by the npm dev server.
