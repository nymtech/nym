## Validators and Tokens

### What's the difference between NYM and uNYM?

> 1 NYM = 1 000 000 uNYM

### Why some Nyx blockchain operations take one hour and others are instant?

This is based on the definition in [Nym's CosmWasm](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/common/cosmwasm-smart-contracts) smart contracts code.

Whatever is defined as [a pending epoch event](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/b07627d57e075b6de35b4b1a84927578c3172811/common/cosmwasm-smart-contracts/mixnet-contract/src/pending_events.rs#L35-L103) will get resolved at the end of the current epoch.

And whatever is defined as [a pending interval event](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/b07627d57e075b6de35b4b1a84927578c3172811/common/cosmwasm-smart-contracts/mixnet-contract/src/pending_events.rs#L145-L172) will get resolved at the end of the current interval.

### Why is validator set entry whitelisted?

We understand that the early days of the Nyx blockchain will face possible vulnerabilities in terms of size - easy to disrupt or halt the chain if a malicious party entered with a large portion of stake. Besides that, there are some legal issues we need to address before we can distribute the validator set in a fully permissionless fashion.
