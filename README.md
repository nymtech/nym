## The Nym Privacy Platform

The platform is composed of multiple Rust crates. Top-level executable binary crates include:

* nym-mixnode - shuffles [Sphinx](https://github.com/nymtech/sphinx) packets together to provide privacy against network-level attackers.
* nym-client - an executable which you can build into your own applications. Use it for interacting with Nym nodes.
* nym-socks5-client - a Socks5 proxy you can run on your machine, and use with existing applications
* nym-gateway - acts sort of like a mailbox for mixnet messages, removing the need for directly delivery to potentially offline or firewalled devices.
* nym-network-monitor - sends packets through the full system to check that they are working as expected, and stores node uptime histories as the basis of a rewards system ("mixmining" or "proof-of-mixing").
* nym-explorer - a (projected) block explorer and (existing) mixnet viewer.
* nym-wallet - a desktop wallet implemented using the [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/en/docs/about/intro) framework.

### Building

Platform build instructions are available on [our docs site](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/build-nym).
Wallet build instructions are also available on [our docs site](https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/nym-apps/wallet#for-developers).

### Developing

There's a `.env.sample-dev` file provided which you can rename to `.env` if you want convenient logging, backtrace, or other environment variables pre-set. The `.env` file is ignored so you don't need to worry about checking it in.

For Typescript components, please see [ts-packages](./ts-packages).

### Developer chat

You can chat to us in [Keybase](https://keybase.io). Download their chat app, then click **Teams -> Join a team**. Type **nymtech.friends** into the team name and hit **continue**. For general chat, hang out in the **#general** channel. Our development takes places in the **#dev** channel. Node operators should be in the **#node-operators** channel.

### Rewards

Node, node operator and delegator rewards are determined according to the principles laid out in the section 6 of [Nym Whitepaper](https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf). Below is a TLDR of the variables and formulas involved in calculating the epoch rewards. Initial reward pool is set to 250 million Nym, making the circulating supply 750 million Nym.

|Symbol|Definition|
|---|---|
|<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R">|global share of rewards available, starts at 2% of the reward pool. 
|<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R_{i}">|node reward for mixnode `i`.
|<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_{i}">|ratio of total node stake (node bond + all delegations) to the token circulating supply.
|<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\lambda_{i}">|ratio of stake operator has pledged to their node to the token circulating supply.
|<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\omega_{i}">|fraction of total effort undertaken by node `i`, set to `1/k`.
|<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k">|number of nodes stakeholders are incentivised to create, set by the validators, a matter of governance. Currently determined by the `reward set` size, and set to 720 in testnet Sandbox.
|<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha">|Sybil attack resistance parameter - the higher this parameter is set the stronger the reduction in competitivness gets for a Sybil attacker.
|<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=PM_{i}">|declared profit margin of operator `i`, defaults to 10% in.
|<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=PF_{i}">|uptime of node `i`, scaled to 0 - 1, for the rewarding epoch
|<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=PP_{i}">|cost of operating node `i` for the duration of the rewarding eopoch, set to 40 NYMT.

Node reward for node `i` is determined as:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R_{i}=PF_{i} \cdot R \cdot (\sigma^'_{i} \cdot \omega_{i} \cdot k %2b \alpha \cdot \lambda^'_{i} \cdot \sigma^'_{i} \cdot k)/(1 %2b \alpha)">

where:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma^'_{i} = min\{\sigma_{i}, 1/k\}">

and

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\lambda^'_{i} = min\{\lambda_{i}, 1/k\}">

Operator of node `i` is credited with the following amount:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=min\{PP_{i},R_{i})\} %2b max\{0, (PM_{i} %2b (1 - PM_{i}) \cdot \lambda_{i}/\delta_{i}) \cdot (R_{i} - PP_{i})\}">

Delegate with stake `s` recieves:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=max\{0, (1-PM_{i}) \cdot (s^'/\sigma_{i}) \cdot (R_{i} - PP_{i})\}">

where `s'` is stake `s` scaled over total token circulating supply.
