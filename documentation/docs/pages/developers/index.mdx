# Introduction
Nym's developer documentation covering core concepts of integrating with the Mixnet, interacting with the Nyx blockchain, an overview of the avaliable tools, and our SDK docs.

## Where to Start?
If you are completely new to Nym, it is suggested to start with the top sections covering the core concepts, integration options, and the clients and tools available to you.

If you feel like starting with more practical examples, check out the relevent SDK docs in the sidebar to the left.
