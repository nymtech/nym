Nyx is a Cosmos SDK blockchain. It records the ledger of `NYM` transactions and executes the smart contracts for distributing `NYM` rewards.

The blockchain plays a supporting but fundamental role in the mixnet: the `NYM` token used to incentivise node operators is one of two native tokens of the chain (the other being `NYX`, used for Blockchain consensus), and the chain is where the Mixnet, Vesting, and zk-nym-related smart contracts are deployed.
