## SDK overview
The Typescript SDK allows developers to start building browser-based mixnet applications quickly, by simply importing the SDK modules into their code via NPM as they would any other Typescript library.

Currently developers can use different packages from the Typescript SDK to do the following entirely in the browser:

| Nym Component  | Functionality | ESM packages   | CJS packages   |
| :-------------: | :----------: |  :---------: |  :---------: |
| Nyx / Validator (all contracts) |  Create a simple query or query and execute client  on any Nyx smart contract  | [Smart Contract Clients](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/contract-clients)  | 
| Mixnet (traffic) | Send & receive traffic over the mixnet |  [Mixnet Client - ESM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk), [Mixnet Client - ESM full-fat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk-full-fat)  | [Mixnet Client - CJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk-commonjs), [Mixnet Client - CJS full-fat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk-commonjs-full-fat) 
| MixFetch  |  Make HTTP requests over the mixnet via the SOCKS5 Network Requester service providers  |   [MixFetch - ESM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/mix-fetch), [MixFetch - ESM full-fat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/mix-fetch-full-fat) | [MixFetch - CJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/mix-fetch-commonjs), [MixFetch - CJS full-fat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/mix-fetch-commonjs-full-fat)
| Coconut (credentials) |  Create and consume Coconut credentials |   [link](), [link]() | [link](), [link]()

  Note that the Nyx `Contract clients` only come in one module system as they don't use WASM.

## SDK module systems
All packages come in four different variations:
- **CommonJS**: These packages use the CommonJS module system. They need to be bundled to work properly in a browser environment;
- **CommonJS full-fat**: These packages are already pre-bundled and also include inline WebAssembly (WASM) and web worker code;
- **ESM**: These packages use the ECMAScript Modules (ESM) system. Like CommonJS, they require bundling for browser compatibility;
- **ESM full-fat**: These ESM packages are pre-bundled and include inline WebAssembly and web worker code;

 
<Callout type="info" emoji="⚠️">
  As the Typescript SDK and associated modules are still a work in progress, note that the inline WASM and web worker versions are likely to have issues if the web site / app / extension has a strict CSP.
