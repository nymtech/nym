# Setup Metric Templates

We at Nym as well as several core community operators had setup different metrics flows. To aggregate data into one database would be the easiest way to go. This approach would defeat the very foundation of distributed network run by operators all over the world.

It can be useful for a one time event or limited time period to use the existing metric infrastructure setup by Nym or other operators but for the purpose of maximal privacy and decentralisation of the data - preventing Nym Mixnet from any global adversary takeover - we would like to use these pages as mutual empowerment, a place where operators can share and learn new skills to **setup metrics on their own infrastructure**.

## Guides to Setup Metrics

Different templates and guides are divided into sub-pages for easier navigation
