# Nym Material UI Theme

This directory contains the theme overrides that customise the Material UI default theme to Nym branding.

## Getting started

If you are unfamiliar with Material UI theming, please read the following first:
- https://mui.com/customization/theming/
- https://mui.com/customization/palette/
- https://mui.com/customization/dark-mode/#dark-mode-with-custom-palette

[mui-theme.d.ts](./mui-theme.d.ts) adds typings to the theme using Typescript's module augmentation.

Read the following if you are unfamiliar with module augmentation and declaration merging. Then
look at the recommendations from Material UI docs for implementation:
- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation
- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#merging-interfaces
- https://mui.com/customization/palette/#adding-new-colors

## Typings

[mui-theme.d.ts](./mui-theme.d.ts) contains the typings for the Nym theme additions and specific Network Explorer theme elements.
