# HTML Nym Mixnet Chat App bundled with Parcel

This is an example of using the Nym Mixnet to send text chat messages in an app bundled with Parcel 2.0.

You can use this example as a seed for a new project.

## Before you start

You will need to have the Rust WASM toolchain installed. Please [follow the instructions here](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/setup.html)
to install `wasm-pack` and then run the sample.

> **VERY IMPORTANT** Please note that this example will build the WASM client locally using Rust and will not use the latest published NPM package.

## Running the example

Try out the chat app by running:

```
yarn
yarn start
```
