# TcpProxy Module
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout type="warning">
  There will be a breaking SDK upgrade in the coming months. This upgrade will make the SDK a lot easier to build with.

This upgrade will affect the interface of the SDK dramatically, and will be coupled with a protocol change - stay tuned for information on early access to the new protocol testnet.

It will also be coupled with the documentation of the SDK on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
</Callout>
This module exposes the `TcpProxyClient` and the `TcpProxyServer` which can be used to proxy traffic through the Mixnet in a way that is more familiar to developers than the methods exposed by the [`Mixnet` module](./mixnet).

Both `Client` and `Server` are intended to be initialised and then run in a background thread, exposing a configurable `localhost` socket which developers can read/write/stream to without having to worry about the [message-based](../concepts/messages) nature of sending and receiving traffic to/from the Mixnet.

> Non-Rust/Go developers who want to experiment with this module can start with the [standalone binaries](../tools/standalone-tcpproxy).
