  There will be a breaking SDK upgrade in the coming months. This upgrade will make the SDK a lot easier to build with.

This upgrade will affect the interface of the SDK dramatically, and will be coupled with a protocol change - stay tuned for information on early access to the new protocol testnet.

It will also be coupled with the documentation of the SDK on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
</Callout>

All the following examples can be found in the `nym-sdk` [examples directory](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/master/sdk/rust/nym-sdk/examples) in the monorepo. Just navigate to `nym/sdk/rust/nym-sdk/examples/` and run the files from there with:

```sh
cargo run --example <NAME_OF_FILE>
```

If you wish to run these outside of the workspace - such as if you want to use one as the basis for your own project - then make sure to import the `sdk`, `tokio`, and `nym_bin_common` crates.
