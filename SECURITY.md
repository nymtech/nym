Critical bug or security issue ðŸ’¥

If you're here because you're trying to figure out how to notify us of a security issue, go to Discord or Matrix, and alert the core engineers:

    Jedrzej Stuczynski, discord: "Jedrzej | Nym#5666" , matrix: @jstuczyn:nymtech.chat
    Mark Sinclair | discord: marknym#8088 , matrix: @mark:nymtech.chat

Please avoid opening public issues on GitHub that contain information about a potential security vulnerability as this makes it difficult to reduce the impact and harm of valid security issues.
