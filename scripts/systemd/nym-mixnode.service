# This is an example systemd service unit illustrating how to make a mixnode
# start and stop automatically on a Linux box which runs on systemd.
# To determine if it is applicable to your system simply run "ps 1". If the
# output mentions "systemd" then you're good to go.
#
# Systemd has pretty sophisticated features to tweak the service runtime
# behavior. If you want to explore them you can start with the official docs:
#    https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html
#    https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html
# However keep in mind that more often than not the defaults work very well.
#
# Directions of use (description and example command)
#  1. Create a "nym" user and group (example for Debian):
#     sudo useradd -U -m -s /sbin/nologin nym
#  2. Start a new bash session with your nym user:
#     sudo -u nym bash
#  3. Change to the user's home directory:
#     cd
#  4. Obtain the current mixnode binary from the nym release page and make it
#     executable:
#     curl -LO https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/download/v0.7.0/nym-mixnode_linux_x86_64
#     chmod 755 nym-mixnode_linux_x86_64
#  5. Initialize the mixnode config (this assumes a simple IPv4 setup):
#     ./nym-mixnode_linux_x86_64 init --id iamboss -layer 2 --host $(curl -sS v4.icanhazip.com)
#  6. Give it a try. The mixnode should run in the foreground until you
#     terminate it with Ctrl-C:
#     ./nym-mixnode_linux_x86_64 run --id iamboss
#  7. Exit from your nym shell:
#     exit
#  8. Copy this file over to /etc/systemd/system/nym-mixnode.service.
#  9. Enable the service so that it will autostart at boot-time:
#     sudo systemctl enable nym-mixnode
# 10. Start the nym service:
#     sudo systemctl start nym-mixnode

KillSignal=SIGINT # gracefully kill the process when stopping the service. Allows node to unregister cleanly.
LimitNOFILE=65535 # this sets a higher ulimit for your mixnode, so it will still work as the network grows
