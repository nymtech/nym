### Which VPS providers would you recommend?

Consider in which jurisdiction you reside and where do you want to run a node. Do you want to pay by crypto or not and what are the other important particularities for your case? We always recommend operators to try to choose smaller and decentralised VPS providers over the most known ones controlling a majority of the internet. Nym operators community started an ISP table called [*Where to host your nym node?*](../community-counsel/isp-list.mdx), check it out and add your findings!

### Why is a node setup on a self-hosted machine so tricky?

We don't recommend this setup because it's really difficult to get a static IP and route IPv6 traffic.

### What's the Sphinx packet size?

The sizes are shown in the configs [here](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/common/nymsphinx/params/src/packet_sizes.rs#L32) (default is the one clients use, the others are for research purposes, not to be used in production as this would fragment the anonymity set). More info can be found [here](https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/common/nymsphinx/anonymous-replies/src/reply_surb.rs#L80).

### Why a Mix Node and a Gateway cannot be bonded with the same wallet?

Because of the way the smart contract works we keep it one-node one-address at the moment. This will change very soon as a `nym-node` will be run with multiple modes.

### Which nodes are the most needed to be setup to strengthen Nym infrastructure and which ones bring rewards?

At this point the most crucial component needed are [Exit Gateways](../nodes/nym-node/setup.mdx#initialise--run) routing wireguard.

### Are Nym Nodes whitelisted?

Nope, anyone can run a Nym Node. whether your node is chosen to mix is purely reliant on the node's performance and reputation (self stake + delegations).
