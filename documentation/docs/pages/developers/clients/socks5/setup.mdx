# Client setup
## Viewing command help

You can check that your binaries are properly compiled with:

```
./nym-socks5-client --help
```

You can check the necessary parameters for the available commands by running:

```
./nym-client <COMMAND> --help
```

## Initialising a new client instance
Before you can use the client, you need to initalise a new instance of it, which can be done with the following command:

```
./nym-socks5-client init --id docs-example --use-reply-surbs true --provider Entztfv6Uaz2hpYHQJ6JKoaCTpDL5dja18SuQWVJAmmx.Cvhn9rBJw5Ay9wgHcbgCnVg89MPSV5s2muPV2YF1BXYu@Fo4f4SQLdoyoGkFae5TpVhRVoXCF8UiypLVGtGjujVPf
```

The `--id` in the example above is a local identifier so that you can name your clients and keep track of them on your local system; it is **never** transmitted over the network.

The `--use-reply-surbs` field denotes whether you wish to send [SURBs](../../network/concepts/anonymous-replies) along with your request. It defaults to `false`, we are explicitly setting it as `true`. It defaults to `false` for compatibility with versions of the pre-smoosh `nym-network-requester` binary which will soon be deprecated.

The `--provider` field needs to be filled with the Nym address of an Exit Gateway that can make network requests on your behalf. You can select one from the [mixnet explorer](https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/gateways) by copying its `Client ID` and using this as the value of the `--provider` flag. Alternatively, you could use [Harbourmaster](https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/).

## Choosing a Gateway
By default - as in the example above - your client will choose a random gateway to connect to.

However, there are several options for choosing a gateway, if you do not want one that is randomly assigned to your client:
* If you wish to connect to a specific gateway, you can specify this with the `--gateway` flag when running `init`.
* You can also choose a gateway based on its location relative to your client. This can be done by appending the `--latency-based-selection` flag to your `init` command. This command means that to select a gateway, your client will:
	* fetch a list of all availiable gateways
	* send few ping messages to all of them, and measure response times.
	* create a weighted distribution to randomly choose one, favouring ones with lower latency.

You can select one from the [mixnet explorer](https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/gateways) by copying its `Client ID` and using this as the value of the `--provider` flag. Alternatively, you could use [Harbourmaster](https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/).

> Note this doesn't mean that your client will pick the closest gateway to you, but it will be far more likely to connect to gateway with a 20ms ping rather than 200ms
