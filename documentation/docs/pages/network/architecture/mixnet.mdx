# Mixnet Components
The mixnet is made up of nodes running in several different roles:
* **Mix Nodes** provide network security for network content _and_ metadata by performing packet-mixing on traffic travelling through the network.
* **Gateways** REWRITE act as message storage for clients which may go offline and come back online again, and defend against denial of service attacks. The default gateway implementation included in the Nym platform code holds packets for later retrieval. For many applications (such as simple chat), this is usable out of the box, as it provides a place that potentially offline clients can retrieve packets from. The access token allows clients to pull messages from the gateway node.
* **Services** are applications that communicate with nym clients, listening and sending traffic to the mixnet. This is an umbrella term for a variety of different pieces of code, such as the Network Requester.

## Smoosh Status
These were originally completely separate binaries. They are in the process of being 'smooshed' together into a single `nym-node` binary which runs in different modes.

Completed:
* The `nym-network-requester` is now part of a `nym-node` running in as an Exit Gateway.

Upcoming:
* Whether a `nym-node` is running as a Gateway or Mix Node will be set based on network conditions, and change epoch to epoch. Currently the role is set manually by the operator and does not change automatically over time.
