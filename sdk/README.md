# Nym SDK

Welcome to the Nym SDK. This is a good starting point for finding resources to build software using Nym components.

The SDK is split into technologies and platforms:

- [Typescript](typescript) - packages for the Javascript ecosystem leveraging Nym's Typescript and WASM clients. Use these to build browser apps, web apps and mobile apps that can make use of the Nym mixnet and Coconut credentials

Coming soon:

- [iOS](ios) - native libraries for iOS, that can be used directly or from React Native using wrappers
- [Android](android) - native libraries for iOS, that can be used via JNI or from React Native using wrappers
