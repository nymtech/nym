# Note if changing these fields:
# - make sure you aren't running `mdbook serve`
# - change value of `turn-off = true` to `false`. This is set to `true` usually to avoid a known constant-reload bug with `mdbook serve` and this preprocessor
# - delete `./theme/` dir
# - change the preprocessor values that you want to edit
# - run `mdbook build`: this will rebuild the `./theme` directory
# - change value of `turn-off` back to `true`
