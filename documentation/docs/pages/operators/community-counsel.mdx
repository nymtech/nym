Running an Exit Gateway is a commitment and as such is exposed to various challenges. Besides different legal regulations typical difficulties may be dealing with VPS or ISP providers. Our strength lies in decentralised community of squads and individuals supporting each other. Sharing examples of [landing pages](landing-pages.md), templates for communication and FAQs is a great way to empower other operators sharing the mission of liberating internet. Below is a simple way how to create a pull request directly to Nym Operator Guide docs.

## How to add content

Our aim is to establish a strong community network, sharing legal findings and other suggestions with each other. We would like to encourage all of the current and future operators to do research about the situation in the jurisdiction they operate in as well as solutions to any challenges when running an Exit Gateway and add those through a pull request (PR). Please check out the [steps to make a pull request](add-content.md).
