//! # Membership behaviour.
//!
//! Ephemera `reliable broadcast` needs to know the list of peers who participate in the protocol.
//! Also it's not enough to have just the list but to make sure that they are actually online.
//! When the list of available peers changes, `reliable broadcast` needs to be notified so that it can adjust accordingly.
//!
//! This behaviour is responsible for keeping membership up to date.
//!
//! `MembersProviderFuture`: `Future<Output = membership::Result<Vec<PeerInfo>>> + Send + 'static`.
//!
//! User provides a [`MembersProviderFuture`] implementation to the [Behaviour] which is responsible for fetching the list of peers.
//!
//! [Behaviour] accepts only peers that are actually online.
//!
//! When peers become available or unavailable, [Behaviour] adjusts the list of connected peers accordingly and notifies `reliable broadcast`
//! about the membership change.
//!
//! It is configurable what `threshold` of peers(from the total list provided by [`MembersProviderFuture`]) should be available at any given time.
//! Or if just to use all peers who are online. See [`MembershipKind`] for more details.
//!
//! Ideally [`MembersProviderFuture`] can depend on a resource that gives reliable results. Some kind of registry which itself keeps track of actually online nodes.
//! As Ephemera uses only peers provided by [`MembersProviderFuture`], it depends on its accuracy.
//! At the same time it tries to be flexible and robust to handle less reliable [`MembersProviderFuture`] implementations.

// When peer gets disconnected, we try to dial it and if that fails, we update group.
// (it may connect us meanwhile).
// Although we can retry to connect to disconnected peers, it's simpler if we just assume that when
// they come online again, they will connect us.

//So the main goal is to remove offline peers from the group so that rb can make progress.

//a)when peer disconnects, we try to dial it and if that fails, we update group.
//b)when peer connects, we will update the group.
