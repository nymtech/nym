### Terms & Conditions

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
From `nym-node` version `1.1.3` onward is required to accept [**Operators Terms & Conditions**](https://nymtech.net/terms-and-conditions/operators/v1.0.0) in order to be part of the active set. Make sure to read them before you add the flag.

There has been a long ongoing discussion whether and how to apply Terms and Conditions for Nym network operators, with an aim to stay aligned with the philosophy of Free Software and provide legal defense for both node operators and Nym developers. To understand better the reasoning behind this decision, you can listen to the first [Nym Operator Town Hall](https://www.youtube.com/live/7hwb8bAZIuc?si=3mQ2ed7AyUA1SsCp&t=915) introducing the T&Cs or to [Operator AMA with CEO Harry Halpin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIN-zYQw0I0) from June 4th, 2024, explaining pros and cons of T&Cs implementation.
