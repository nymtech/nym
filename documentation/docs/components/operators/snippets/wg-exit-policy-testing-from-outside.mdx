- Install these dependencies on your local machine:
```shell
sudo apt install tcpdump

sudo tcpdump -i nymwg -n
```
- Connect to [NymVPN](https://nym.com) and select your node as an Exit Gateway (after running the exit policy [manager script](#wireguard-exit-policy-configuration))
- Run the `tcpdump` command before registering
- Have the output of the `echo $BLOCKED_IP` from your node and try to go into your browser or a registered client and try to connect - It will not resolve.
