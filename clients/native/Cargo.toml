# dependencies to review:
futures = "0.3" # bunch of futures stuff, however, now that I think about it, it could perhaps be completely removed
# the AsyncRead, AsyncWrite, Stream, Sink, etc. traits could be used from tokio
# channels should really be replaced with crossbeam due to that implementation being more efficient
# and the single instance of abortable we have should really be refactored anyway
