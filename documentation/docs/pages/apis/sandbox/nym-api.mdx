# NymAPI

The [NymAPI](../../operators/nodes/validator-setup/nym-api) is a sidecar binary operated by members of the Nym Validator set. Amongst other things, the API offers endpoints to query regarding circulating `NYM` supply, and global and ticketbook-specific [zk-nym](../../network/cryptography/zk-nym) data. This is all information contained in various smart contracts on the Nyx blockchain; the NymAPI caches this information periodically to make queries faster and more scalable.
