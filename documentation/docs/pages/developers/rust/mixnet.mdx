# Mixnet Module
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout type="warning">
  There will be a breaking SDK upgrade in the coming months. This upgrade will make the SDK a lot easier to build with.

This upgrade will affect the interface of the SDK dramatically, and will be coupled with a protocol change - stay tuned for information on early access to the new protocol testnet.

It will also be coupled with the documentation of the SDK on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

This module exposes the logic of creating and interacting with clients and Mixnet messages. This is recommended for those wanting to either start playing around with the Mixnet and how it works, or build connection logic.

> For developers wanting something more 'plug and play' we recommend the [`TcpProxy` module](./tcpproxy).
