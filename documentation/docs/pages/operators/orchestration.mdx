# Orchestration of Multiple Nym Nodes 

Nym is a distributed network operated by admins all around the world. As the network grows, it attracts experienced operators of various infrastructure and builds an ever evolving community of builders, developers, admins and privacy enthusiasts. 

Operators form squads, DAOs and different entities managing multiple nodes per organisation. Orchestration of multiple servers with Nym nodes allows operators to be more efficient in deployment, changes implementation and upgrade flow following our demanding [release cycle](/operators/release-cycle).

The operators who understand well basic `nym-node` [requirements](/operators/nodes#minimum-requirements) and general server administration, can use these two guides to lower cost and energy spent to maintain their nodes.
