Dear <ISP>:

Thank you for forwarding me the notice you received from <COPYRIGHT_CLAIMANT> regarding <CONTENT>. I would like to assure you that I am not hosting the claimed infringing materials, and furthermore, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's ("DMCA") safe harbors likely protect you from liability arising from this complaint. The notice is likely based upon misunderstandings about the law and about some of the software I run.

As you know, the DMCA creates four "safe harbors" for service providers to protect them from copyright liability for the acts of their users, when the ISPs fulfill certain requirements. (17 U.S.C. 512)
The DMCA's requirements vary depending on the ISP's role. You may be familiar with the "notice and takedown" provisions of section 512(c) of the DMCA; however, those do not apply when an ISP merely acts as a conduit.
Instead, the "conduit" safe harbor of section 512(a) of the DMCA has different and less burdensome eligibility requirements, as the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held in RIAA v. Verizon (see https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15815830240179540527) and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed in RIAA v. Charter (see https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11547531128234336420).

Under DMCA 512(a), service providers like you are typically protected from damages for copyright infringement claims if you also maintain "a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers and account holders of the service provider's system or network who are repeat infringers."
If you have and implement such a policy, and you otherwise qualify for the safe harbor, you should be free from fear of copyright damages.

The copyright notice you received was likely triggered by a program I run called Nym. Nym is a network software that helps users to enhance their privacy, security, and safety online.
It does not host any content. Rather, it is part of a network of nodes on the Internet that simply pass packets among themselves before sending them to their destinations, just as any Internet intermediary does.
The difference is that Nym tunnels the connections such that no hop can learn both the source and destination of the packets, giving users protection from nefarious snooping on network traffic.
The result is that, unlike most other Internet traffic, the final IP address that the recipient receives is not the IP address of the sender.
Nym protects users against hazards such as harassment, spam, and identity theft. Nym aims to carry on from Panoramix by building a decentralized authentication and payment protocol. It will enable developers to build their own sustainable privacy-enhanced services. Panoramix is an EU-funded Horizon 2020 programme with the goal of protecting communication privacy by building a comprehensive mixnet infrastructure. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Grant Agreement No 653497, "Privacy and Accountability in Networks via Optimized Randomized Mix-nets (Panoramix)” (For more on Nym, see https://www.nym.com/, For more on Panoramix, see https://panoramix.me/ .)
I hope, as an organization committed to protecting the privacy of its customers, you'll agree that this is a valuable technology.

While the Nym node that I run may appear to be the source of material that is alleged to be copyright-infringing, I do not host that material.
I do not select the material transmitted through the Nym node that I run, and I have no practical means of either identifying the source of such material or preventing its transmission.
I do nothing to encourage or promote the use of the Nym network for copyright infringement.
For these reasons, I am not an infringer of copyright in any materials that are transmitted through the Nym node that I run, either directly or under a theory of contributory or vicarious liability.
Therefore, you should continue to be protected under the DMCA 512(a) safe harbor without taking any further action.

Thank you for working with me on this matter. As a loyal subscriber, I appreciate your notifying me of this issue and hope that the protections of DMCA 512 put any concerns you may have to rest.
If not, please contact me with any further questions.

Very truly yours,
Your customer, <YOUR_NAME/PSEUDONYM>
